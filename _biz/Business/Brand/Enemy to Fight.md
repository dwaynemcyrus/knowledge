For individuals like Samira and Adam, these widely accepted norms create a challenging environment where integrating their spiritual, emotional, and relational needs is difficult. The pressure to conform to these norms can lead to internal conflicts, emotional suppression, and a sense of disconnection from their true selves and those around them. They may struggle to find harmony and fulfillment amidst the demands of modern life, feeling torn between their aspirations for holistic well-being and the prevailing societal expectations.

Shared norms amongst our profiles:
#### Compartmentalization:
   - **Spirituality vs. Daily Life:** People often separate their spiritual beliefs from their everyday actions and decisions. Faith is practiced in isolation, typically during designated times (e.g., prayers, religious services) rather than being integrated into daily routines and interactions.
   - **Work-Life Balance:** There is a strict division between professional life and personal life, with little overlap between work responsibilities and personal or family time.
#### Surface-Level Relationships
   - **Superficial Interactions:** Relationships, especially in social and professional settings, tend to be shallow and transactional, focusing on immediate benefits rather than deep, meaningful connections.
   - **Avoidance of Vulnerability:** There is a general reluctance to show vulnerability or discuss personal struggles openly, which leads to emotional disconnection and isolation.
#### Individualism
   - **Self-Reliance:** Emphasis on self-reliance and independence often overshadows the importance of seeking help, community support, or collective well-being.
   - **Personal Achievement:** Success is frequently measured by personal achievements and material wealth rather than the quality of relationships or spiritual fulfillment.
#### Emotional Suppression
   - **Emotional Control:** There is a societal expectation to maintain control over one's emotions, often leading to suppression rather than healthy expression and processing of feelings.
   - **Stigma Around Therapy:** Seeking emotional or psychological help is sometimes stigmatized, viewed as a sign of weakness rather than a proactive step toward well-being.
#### Reactive Living
   - **Crisis Management:** People often live reactively, addressing issues and conflicts as they arise rather than proactively cultivating habits and practices that prevent these issues.
   - **Short-Term Solutions:** There is a tendency to seek quick fixes for problems rather than investing in long-term personal growth and emotional healing.
#### Cultural and Social Pressure
   - **Conformity:** Social and cultural pressures often dictate behavior, leading individuals to conform to societal norms and expectations at the expense of personal authenticity and well-being.
   - **Status and Appearance:** Maintaining a certain image or status can take precedence over genuine self-expression and emotional health.
#### Technology and Distraction
   - **Digital Overload:** Excessive reliance on technology and social media can lead to distraction and superficial engagement with others, detracting from face-to-face interactions and meaningful relationships.
   - **Instant Gratification:** The culture of instant gratification promotes impatience and a preference for immediate rewards over the delayed gratification of long-term personal growth and spiritual fulfillment.

### Additional ideas no.1
**The enemy that people are fighting…** conformity to the chaos of society and the emotional slavery that has been presented as the right path away from good orderly direction. To live defeated, self-sabotaging, and accepting of abuse — to be away righteousness (family and community) and to be consumed with hedonism. 

In short, weak men.

**The ideal life people are fighting for…** the freedom to decide — to be sovereign, to be righteous. To live by good orderly direction and for family and community to be the foundation of our lives on earth. 

### Additional ideas no.2
Mentally colonized men who have bought into the idea that women are to blame (RedPill, Closer to Whiteness, Colonizer Mentality, etc.) for anything and that our role on this planet is meaningless. At best we are just to be cheap labour and free wallets to fund chaos in the societies to which we live. The idea of [[Allah|The Great Creator]] is foolish and the universal laws are not to be follow, idolize oneself and bath in hedonism. Defending the bad and discouraging the good. To keep boys and in-turn men to be weak, feeble, depressed, drained, and hopeless so that the women and children we are to protect are left vulnerable to the evil and lost (weak) men among us, especially those is control of major systems, resources, and influences.
