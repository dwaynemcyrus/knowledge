So I’m taking the bus for the first time in over a year. I am amongst the people. I got the chance to run over and give a dropped toy to a little girl who was fussing and crying. The mother seemed out of it when I tried to ask her if the toy was hers, so instead I knelt down and asked the child. No words just gesture she stopped crying reached out and I confirmed with a few glances of it was okay for me to put it in her reach from the mother. The mother didn’t give any dismissive looks so I did and immediately after my bus was present.

So I am waiting on the second bus and it has occurred to me that I am better than this! Seriously… 34 on the bus, no phone service, old clothes, WTF! Back around Scarborough people the ratchet mess of people with coloured hair, wearing indoor slippers outside, oversized clothing, sagging pants… the list goes on! 

  

WHat The Fuvk! 

  

Seriously, Dwayne is this how you want to live, you don’t belong amongst these people! You are different, you have been different!! You need to change immediately! And you know exactly how and what to do.

  

STOP FUCKING UP YOU LIFE, you have done enough damage!
