More often than not I have observed here in Basel the when people walk, run, and bike, they do so as though the world should move out of their way. This applies to children as well and that I have found very troublesome.Â 

My son even asked if in Canada the people are as rough after he had just been shoved around a few times by the adults passing by as he stood on the side of the path eating.
