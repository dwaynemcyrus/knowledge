Polygyny & Coward Muslim Men

——————————————

Today we have “men” who are getting emotional and fighting tooth and nail to not tell the first why that they have married a second. 

  

My questions are simple?

  

Would our Prophet PBUH fear being honest?

  

Would our Prophet PBUH fear dealing with his wives? 

  

Does the character of our Prophet speak towards righteousness as men?

  

Why hide and be a coward, just lie to your first wife?

  

WEAK MALE BEHAVIOUR AT ITS FINEST FOLKS…
