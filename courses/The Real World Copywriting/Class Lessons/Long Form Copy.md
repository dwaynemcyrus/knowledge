## Notes
### What is long form copy
- long form copy refers to VSL landing pages, copy webinars sales pages, 
- long form content that can take someone from where they are to a conversion 
- Writing long form is using all the skills from short form in combinations
- Long form is more valuable to business than short for as it’s responsible for conversions get people to pull out their wallet for example
- It’s where a lot of the money is as a copywriter. Imagine sales made on high ticket products ($1k) say you get 2% per is $20, 1% per is $10, 20% per is $200

### Long Form Copy Outline
- This is a live review of the following content: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1VKUAL59y5491frP-ywfOC6po4Yn7jjsumvM58UrhsQM/edit?usp=sharing
- this is a loose outline and the sections change based on needs
- All sales pages shift beliefs, help reader to buy product, teach new lessons
- The elements discussed are found  in most if not all long form pages. Elements being headline, lead, body, close
#### Headline: 
- grab attention to have them think about it all day long, build massive curiosity, it’s about the reader, headlines make or break 
#### Lead: 
- It’s similar to PAS and or das, you make big promise, revealing the pain, tease the solution to dream state, and create great openings 
- Consumption of your sales page depends on how good your headline is and the lead: 
- Connecting to their pain, making big promise, teasing certain things that will be reviewed in the rest of the page, establishing credibility, so they want something, they’re curious about something, and it’s just safe and real enough for them  continue on
#### Body: 
- the whole point is to red pill them on how the world really works, bring them the reality of the world.
- Shift their beliefs, to show them how they what they need to do to get the dream state ut not how
- There's usually a discovery story, taking the reader on the journey of discovery that the Guru took, its a story on how the guru found the solution
- This is to show them the reader how the too can achieve the same result
- Start with the height of drama to open the loop
- Then show the Gurus struggles and be sure not to make the Guru look like a loser, you want him to look like a good guy who just had a problem because of a lack of  understanding/knowledge or misbelief, keep it to something simple that our solution easily solves
- ie. "he was a good guy who worked hard and just didn't understand how to make use of credit"
- You want to give the reader a chance to empathize with the Guru, so they can relate and see he's gone through the same as them
- The user should read the body, and end up with a ton of cuestions and a shited mindset, easger to impliment what the solution in the body
#### Close:
- Introduce the product and help them make their purchase decision by staking new beliefs, you want 
- Position the product or service as the vehicle for them to act on and impliment the solution you have provided
- After you tease the product you want to add a few testimonials
- Create massive FOMO you want to tease the actual product without giving the product, use lots of fascination bullet points
- Hit them hard in the feels to push them over the edge so that they make the decision
- Hit them up with value stacking, what's in the product then introduce the price
- Stack additional value with bonus to give the reader a sense of added benefit on top of the product, the extras
- Lay down in forms of gaurantee and risk reversals
- End off with the 3 way close
- This can be structured in many ways for a sales page, the key is to have all of the elements in place

These pages can be structured in many ways for a sales page, the key is to have all of the elements in place
