**Definition:** The conditions and influences that surround you at home and work that impact your growth, health and progress.
## Akhirah
To have a place that is not filled with idols, one where I can set the standard for my future family to pray and live as Muslims without oppression.
## Vision
My compound of a house with room for my wives to live together and my children with an internal courtyard. The pool has an optional open and close roof that is hidden within the property. A dedicated room for prayer that can hold up to 20 people comfortably complete with wudu stations for the men and women separately.
The main home is in a warm region with great access to other countries and is under Islamic law with a local Masjid 5-10 minutes away. And sometimes I make the Adhan from my home and invite my neighbours and those around to pray inside with me. This area stays open as long as I am home for the safety of my wives and children. Otherwise, it is strictly for my wives, children and the women of the community.
Deeply involved in my community as I take care of them and lead them in all things. Just like Talha, I am that guy when you need anything, I will find and provide for you from Allah.
Nature is all around me and accessible to me within walking distance.
My life is such that it is somewhat nomadic where I move my family and wives from place to place to live or I go on my own as I own a few properties in various Islamic countries. One of my properties is a condo in the heart of Downtown Toronto in the art/fashion district and the other in an affluent art collectors district in Manhattan.
I will also have a number of passports around the world so that I am not stuck in anyone country.
My compound also houses my work studio loft that is further described in [[The Work Visualized]].
