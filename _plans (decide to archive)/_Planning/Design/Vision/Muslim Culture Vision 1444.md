## Akhirah
A voice is needed to combat the falsehood and ignored issues within the community to encourage proper practice of Islam.
This is a list of the major issues you see in the world that this work is meant to address over the years:
- Racism the prevails especially to “black” Muslims
- Nationalism the guides too many of the cultures that make up the Ummah
- The impact of modernism, RedPill, and Feminism
- Femniside that occurs and abuse of women and men from those following culture
- The targeting of “revert” Muslimah as easy marriage targets
- The devision base on groups that stems from politics or schools
- Lack of Muslim media
## Vision
The practical fundamentals of Islam are being taught with digital Muslim media. The knowledge is wide spread within and outside the community correcting the cultural influence and false understanding of our practices. The 19% of men are now in place and correcting the wrongs of other men while protecting and standing for our women’s rights.
The culture of Muslims are changed from being culture centric to Islam centric in their daily lives. With an an actual place that is run by Shariah Law where Muslims are welcome to stay build families without concern of racism, nationalism, or classism.
As a prominent figure of Islam I am leading and setting the foundations for all of this change to occur within the community by the will of Allah SWT and the election of the people. The economy has also been centralized through the use of digital and fiat currency globally similar that of the Jewish community.
### Impact After Death
The Muslim community has changed for the better as whole with a clear separation from those who prefer the modernist ways. The men have held the proper position according to [[The Last Sermon]], Sunnah, and Qur’an that’s based in what is practical and not extreme.
### Destination
I have risen as prolific Muslim speaker with a Muslim media company that highlight the stories of the people without outside influence.
