## How to Going Viral
- Don’t go into this with the mindset that every Tweet must go viral
- The aim here is to increase the chances of going viral
- Use attention grabbing words that speak to your niche that they use (the market):
	-  Making $ in ‘X’ days
	- In your 20s
	- $10k per month
	- Hard pill to swallow
	- Life hack
	- Passive income
- Study what others are doing that’s working and emulate it
- Use proper spacing and say the same thing but with less words
- You want to be slightly controversial in your opinions to provoke comments
- Thought provoking, but not too controversial 
## Keys to Viral Tweets
- Relatable
- Short and punchy
- Leveraging memes 
- Say things that you believe that counter the popular opinion at that time
- Never call out everyone, everyone will eventually turn on you
- Going viral is about the timing, being relatable, and what’s currently popular
