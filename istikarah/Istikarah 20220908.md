**Sept 8**

  

Is it beneficial for me to get back into entrepreneurship or not?

  

91:5 I’m not sure what this means Allah it’s seems for stern but speaks toward building as well. (1-10) The conversations speaks greatly to the greatness and creations of Allah and for us me to do right by Allah. Could this refer to my previous Istikarah that’s been made

  

79:15 Your telling me to take not of the story of Moses. Born, Abandoned, Returned to lead the people. I cannot lead the people if I am not independent. (12-19) Allah I am meant to speak, okay I will speak! 

  

108:1 So this right here is the permission yes. (1-3) Pit in the work and do not worry about those who do not understand and or in fact hate you, for it.

  

83:22 Remain pious in this work, and pursuit it. I’m getting a bigger sense of Allah telling me to push with the speaking and community work. That’s what’s been sitting in my heart this entire time. Allah really does know our hearts.

  

23:109 Ask Allah for mercy plenty of it, and it is time to align your belief in Allah with what is good and what you are meant to be doing. (109-111) Speak brother, speak for of the Ummah and the women and what is true!
