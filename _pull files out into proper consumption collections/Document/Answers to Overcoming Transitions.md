## What do you consider your strengths?
### My core strengths are:
1. Strategic
2. Learner
3. Futuristic
4. Focus
5. Self-Assurance

### The great accomplishments 
#### Making daily art for 90 days straight in the mediums of poetry, digital abstract poster, conte drawn by expressions, and acrylic abstract paintings. 

How I accomplished the task
1. I decided what I wanted the end to look like loosely
2. I fought myself to get started and started anyway
3. I allowed myself to just express in the moment with the work
4. I shared the process and the end results publicly which helped me remain accountable 

Why I found the task rewarding
I placed all of my emotions into the work every single day, no days off. I allowed my art to speak for me without hesitation. People gravitated to my process and I even sold 2 original paintings which was a bonus to what was already successful.

#### Building a folding city as a child that I could hind and preserve for play. 
How I accomplished the task
1. I recognized the problem, that my artwork kept being thrown out.
2. I started to experience with how to make 3D structures fold flat and maintain its structure when I erect it again.
3. I built my city and played in it with my toys 

Why I found the task rewarding
What I made was successful it literally stood the test of time as my personal play place that defeated the enemy. I created my own world despite the threatening environment.

#### Starting and running my dance event series as a teenager which spread across the GTA and became ground zero for many well known dancers and dance studios today.
How I accomplished the task
1. My fellow dancers wanted to have spaces to showcase their abilities and compete. I heard the need and I began.
2. Reached out to the human resources I had access to and took advantage of my skills as an artist &designer along with my natural abilites to speak and bring people together.
3. With mentorship I began to create the messaging and the teams required to get our first event together
4. From their I operated in the unknown just dealing with the next, never worrying about whether it will even work
5. Our first event was a success in all metrics and I repeated and improved with each following event

Why I found the task rewarding
I created my own opportunity despite any fears or doubts. I knew I could make it work and just ran with this understanding. I operated on all aspects of my being, employing every part of me to the work. I stretched myself far beyond what I knew possible to achieve success.

## Are you going through significant changes right now?
The recovery from feeling depression after ending my engagement and finding the parts of me I put away to fit in. 
- Avoiding risk taking
- Isolating myself from getting close to others
- Lost confidence in my ability to think of a future

Being a designer when my heart moves me towards a true career path as an art advisor
- I am not inspired or expressive 
- I play it self to just “fit in” rather than being who I am

Moving to New York to live in my own place again to leave the box of a room filled with the clutter of other people’s belongings
- No room to just express myself freely as a creative to take risks
- I cannot trust that what I leave in the room will not be touched or moved or taken
- Restricted in my movements 

Where I currently live is surrounded by islamaphobia towards me
- It has made my practice very uncomfortable
- I hide myself to avoid the commentary and hearing the negative content often playing
- No sense of safety to just be human

The struggle to accept that I am an artist who has already sold paintings and have had a community of supporters.
- Its pushing me to force myself to let go of old ways of being

## Do you have freedom to do things your way?
In the place I reside I have to operate the way others demand. I do not operate in the ways that are natural to me. 

The transition into a career path as a fine artist and art advisor has been occurring in a ways that are natural to me. One step at a time not knowing the path, but moving with full speed anyway.

Holding space and building a community around myself as a speaker has me toggling between doing things my way (majority of the time) and being compelled to do things someone else’s way, but fighting it for the former.

## Is your job or your current project personally rewarding?
As an art advisor I am aware of what is expected of me as I transition into a career that I can flourish in which is tremendously exciting for me.
- Show up
- Do the work
- Trust the process

As an artist I have the opportunity to do my best, but it requires me to commit to letting go of the ideas that my environment dictates what I can accomplish. 
- Make art daily! 
- Share that art with your community
- Embrace being ugly and messy, unpolished

## If your current situation could be changed, what factors would you change?
- Move myself to New York in the north of Brooklyn to surround myself with new opportunities 
- Purchase a new set of tools to build my travel friendly and remote studio for art and work
- Work with a consultancy leaning toward the client management side to learn of the art market
- Spend dedicated time training my creative skills in writing and drawing in addition to consistent knowledge acquisition and work as a synthesizer
