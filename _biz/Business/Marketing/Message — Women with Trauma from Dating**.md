**Message — Women with Trauma from Dating**

  

You’re a good woman, and you are hurting. Struggling to be found by the right man is keeping you awake at night as the time keeps ticking by. 

  

A never ending cycle of falling in love, getting used, and being left.

  

You are carrying anxiety, stress, and pain, it’s overwhelming. You are terrified of being hurt, as you fight the feeling of desperation to be loved and treated well.

  

There’s a way out. 

  

Your boundaries need to be reset and to do it we must address the issues you carry from the past.

  

Together, you and I can stop the emotional bleeding, but you have to start now. Your emotions will betray you and that’s what toxic men prey on. The longer you wait and run away from addressing your broken boundaries the longer you will feel alone and unworthy. 

  

We can change this.

I want you to close your eyes for a few moments and feel life will be like when you no longer allow toxic men into your mind, heart, and body.

  

How did feel? Good right.

  

When you take control and maintain your boundaries this is what you gift yourself: 

- Greatly reduced stress, emotional pain, and weight on your heart. 
- Improved confidence and self-esteem knowing you’re worthy and living it daily.
- The cycle of toxic relationships is over only investing in bonds that are fulfilling and intentional. 
- No more wasted time, you spot the red flags and promptly excuse yourself.
- Prepared to make room for the right man to enter your life.

  

It doesn’t have to be a dream in your mind. You can make this your reality starting today.

The longer you take to truly heal your heart the more you are going to suffer. Healing in isolation without guidance, without someone to hold your hand is not the way. 

  

Imagine a doctor trying to perform critical surgery on herself. Yeah, well your heart is no different.

  

Continuing to date (which is a problem of itself) with a wounded heart is giving yourself to the wolves. You are just manifesting more and more pain in your search to fill the void of love that you have not given yourself.

  

To be used. To be abused. And on repeat.

  

This destroys your self-confidence and is leaving you in an ever deepening pit of feeling unloved, unworthy, and inadequate as a woman and future wife. You are better than that. You deserve to give yourself better than that.

  

The longer you continue this cycle, the more difficult it becomes for you to allow yourself to be seen and treated as the (hidden) wife that you know you are. Those trust issues will only get larger and you will continue living in a state of toxic self-fulfilling prophecy. 

  

You are manifesting the life you live and making it progressively worse as time goes on.

  

The sooner you begin the real work, the scary work, the work that requires you took in the mirror and say, “I am responsible and I will no longer play the victim” the less damage you will have to suffer through and eventually repair. Making a decision to change, is a decision to love yourself. You do not need to remain in a state of inner torment, masking it with “feel better” posts of yourself on TikTok and Instagram. 

  

Healing is a right that is afforded to all people, and I encourage you to take a stand for your right to be healed and loved completely.

This is where you are going to begin, because we all need to start somewhere. Below are the steps you are going to take to get moving with intention.

  

Step 01: Self-Reflection and Healing

- Start journaling about all of your past traumas and their impact on your current life. The journaling is to be done over time and daily in baby steps.
- Find a simple meditation technique on you focused on breath work from YouTube. Practise this daily to get comfortable with yourself.

Step 02: Setting Boundaries and Standards

- Look at your past relationships and write out the red flags that were present, especially the ones you ignored. Be brutally honest with yourself.
- Define your personal values and relationship standards based on your red flags.

Step 03:  Building Self-Worth and Confidence

- Develop a daily practise of self-care, affirmations, and positive self-talk
- Choose an activity or hobby that you genuinely enjoy make time to do it daily if not a few times a week

Step 04: Seeking Support and Guidance

- Reach out to trusted family or friends and share with them the journey you are beginning, this can also be an online community of shared experiences and advice
- Look into and consider participating in counselling or therapy to work through past trauma

Step 05: Embracing Vulnerability and Trust

- Practise trusting yourself by giving yourself small unique challenges to do each day and do them
- With people you feel comfortable with make deliberate decisions to be a little bit more expressive of your feelings and thoughts.

  

Remember, you need to give yourself grace as you go thorough these steps. This is a process with yourself, and you are worthy and deserving of a healed heart and stubborn boundaries.
