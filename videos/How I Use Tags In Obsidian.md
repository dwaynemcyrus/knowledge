## What are tags for?
Tags are about filtering data in your Notion vault for sorting and locating information.
**Use cases:**
- Status filters: in progress, on hold, etc.
- Type of notes: evergreen, literature, etc.
## Tags vs Links
- Tagging means two notes have an indirect connection, they fall under a similar category or topic
- Linking means these two notes have a direct connection
## Tags for Pre-MOCs
- The purpose is to tag content that is not yet ready to be made into a [[Map Of Content]], but is on the way.
- An example would be using nested tags `PreMoc > Photography`
- This setup allows you to find information when you are ready to group information
