### Squads and Teamwork
There is a reason special forces training is done in Squads.

There are 5 Squads in this 30-day Bootcamp.

You will be randomly assigned to one, and those will be the only people you can speak to.

This is designed so that I and @Ole can work with you all on a more personal basis.

You guys will be allowed to share what you've learned within your squad using the Student Lessons Channel.

You guys can ask each other questions using the ask-students channel.
