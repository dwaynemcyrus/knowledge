2:101 The truth is in the Qur’an you ask Allah SWT of these things like they were not already revealed to you.

45:15 Are you doing this as a good deed? Yes, a good to myself. So accept the blessing from Allah SWT.

40:50 Proofs have been given to you, signs. So when will operate of belief and faith. Make this happen, Allah SWT has given permission for this.

23:39 Demand of Allah SWT to support you. However, your part is to move, make the moves! 

114:3 There is one God and that is Allah SWT, so act and behave as though you have a relationship and that what you want is nothing for Allah SWT to provide you.
