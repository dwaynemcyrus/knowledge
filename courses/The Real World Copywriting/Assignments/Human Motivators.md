## Pain of my Current State
- No car or driver’s license
- No job that I care for it, in fact the one I have now gives me so much stress I pulled out all of my facial hair
- My body is weak as fuck and looks like a damn child
- I sleep on my prayer mat and a layer of my comforter folded 
- “My room” is a 5x4 space and half of that is my single desk with old fucking tech
- I don’t have space for myself to breathe to exist
- There is no natural light and the one bulb here is yellow and garbage
- I feel absolute garbage and pissed of about myself because of how I live
- I have lost my abilities to draw and paint even though it is what I crave most in my life, it’s fucked up that I keep denying this
- I can’t stand the state of my life
- I am living in a country that I have absolutely zero desire to be in
- Literally I sit on hold that can be used to change my situation by my own hands and I don’t like an idiot
- My brain has been set for sabotage like a dummy 
- All I need is reliable money coming in each month to change fucking everything
- I don’t show myself the love and discipline that is required to honour the body Allah has given me
- My iman and practise of Islam has become incredibly weak and I near hate myself for it 
- My body is so fucking small!!! 
- My beard, my beautiful beard I destroyed 
- Eating garbage is the normal for me
- Surrounding by my mothers stuff stifling me
- The mind that sits I my skull runs me and I’m it’s bitch
- All of my tech is old and can die any minute 
- I have so much talent and skill, yet I hide them and not reap the rewards from my efforts
