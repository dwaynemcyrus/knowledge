**Definition:** The image that you hold of yourself including an assessment of of your qualities, abilities, appearance, and self-worth.
## Akhirah
Developing and maintaining my self-image is the first form of [[Dawah]] that I can give to others. By being an example of what a top-tier Muslim is to be like will inspire others to better understand us.
## Vision
Undeniably Muslim in every sense from speech, to body language, to dress.
I am highly skilled in storytelling across mediums having achieved mastery. The confidence that I have in my abilities to produce are unmatched. My dress is recognizable even in silhouette with a creative and regal appearance that is all custom made by myself. 
No longer do I struggle with a sense of self-worth that causes me to become paralyzed in thought and in action. I am the [[Actualized Self]] and everybody else knows it. My body is built and strong, powerful and gentle. My hair has grown out into locs and are maintained beautifully as a compliment to my amazing skin that nice and clear. 
I am in peak fitness similar to that of a gymnast on the rings at 20 years of age and the flexibility of a female yoga instructor. I know that my life is mine and I experience is as such every single day.
There’s a few jewels that I wear with me on a daily basis those being my earrings, rings, and maybe a necklace all in black and stone.
There is a pride that I have in myself at all time because of the man, the leader that I have become.
### Destination
A Rijal, a dangerous man in custom modest dress and everyday lifestyle is that of a Muslim from where I go to how I speak.
