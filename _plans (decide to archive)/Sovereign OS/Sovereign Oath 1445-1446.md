## The Greatest Good
Become completely self-sufficient as the sole provider for myself and family with my own business.
## States of Jihad
* Provide completely for my family and fulfill all of my wife's and kid's rights.
* Kill the imposter me and let the real man, the true self take form.
* Become the 0.1 percent of Muslims, be like the Sahabah in all things.
## The One Focus
A one-person (with a single well-paid virtual assistant, maybe it is my wife) online education business teaching and coaching on personal development for trauma survivors in the process of post-traumatic growth with a single offer, a gravity shell selling deeper access to me. 

Clients work on my time and schedule, they adapt to me. Zero sales calls, working from anywhere with internet connected top-specs (all devices) iPad (x3 13” 11” 7”) and iPhone (x2 6.9” 6.3”) Pro as the only tools I need (and MacBook Pro as a bonus) in less than 4 hours (between Fajr and Dhuhr) a day 6 days week, earning 240’000 CHF each month at 96% margins (after 24% tax, after costs, after all of it) in profit with deposits to my personal bank account being daily if not weekly.

Any scheduled calls is done from Sunday to Tuesdays with the rest of the time is open in my calendar, free from client commitments. Two weeks before and after the month of Ramadan is always off, and my profit does not stop flowing in with very happy and supported clients. This is my 10 month work year.
### Motivations
* Giving back to all of the people who put into me throughout the years.
* Giving my artist child the opportunity and the tools he was never given to explore and nurture his creativity and voice
* To experience the man that I am despite the wounds of trauma, so that the world can finally embrace me in all of my greatness.
* Becoming closer to the Great Creator through submission and service to the Ummah especially as a protector for the sisters and an example for the brothers.
* To take care of my Mom, little sister Destiny, and future family.
### Istikarah
I made the first one and then I doubted myself and in turn the words Allah SWT and signs Allah SWT has given me then made the second and got warned. 😓😬

I had another moment of doubt and need of reassurance so I made Istikarah again.

It’s been 6 months of doubt and failure. Deep doubt and [[whispers of Shaitan]] had me in circles and far from Allah SWT.

## Al-Mu’min
The Infuser of Faith, today on 6 Dhu'l-Q 1445 (14 May 2024) I make this commitment to submit myself as a Muslim as a man, as a husband, and as a father. I am in need of your assistance, I am going to move forward on faith that this business of educating and coaching will move me towards my rightful purpose. I know that I have made countless Istikarah and they have lead me to this work. I do not know the way Ya Rabb, but I do know the next steps, and that I am working to serve you and walk the rightful path. 

Please Ya Rabb, as long as I do the work and be humble and ask for help from others that you allow me to become financially self-sufficient so that I may take care of myself, my family, and my tribe. I am committing to this single work of education to serve others. I ask that in this work and on this journey you allow me to remain with my wife and kids such that we never have to separate again. 

My lesson has been learned, there is no success in hiding and living small.

I will now take up room, Ameen.
