Teach others to expose the gaps in your knowledge by writing for the public. Writing short form and exposing it to the public provides feedback from those who read. Their comments are the sign posts of possible gaps. Once these gaps are acknowledged go back to the source material or find yourself related source material to fill in the gaps one at a time.
