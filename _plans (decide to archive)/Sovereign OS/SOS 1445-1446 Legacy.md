## Phase 01
### The Journey 
#### What are the major problems/challenges you have or are currently overcoming in your entire life this far?
**Past:**
* Getting out of my bad relationship, it was my fault for being a bitch and allowing myself to loose focus on my purpose. Just letting my self get walked all over and played and used. I made myself conform to being weak in order to be accepted, to not ruffle feathers.
* Overcoming and processing my sexual abuse, childhood abuse, and relational/emotional abuse.
* Getting through being homeless and bouncing around from couch to couch

**Present:**
* Developing and becoming the artist and storyteller I have always meant to be as a creative, truly going all in!
* Breaking the cycle of poverty and poor relationships with money in order to become completely and abundantly self-sufficient financially.
* Creating a life that allows me to live as a Muslim not constrained, no oppression, fully embraced, all the way to Hijrah.
* Reconditioning my mind to be in full control, not needing dopamine kicks to get through the day, becoming a stoic and having complete control of my emotions.
* Learning to develop into a true strong stable self-sufficient healthy man living in my purpose, my best self, the man I am inside is reflected on the outside with results in every category.
* Embracing my masculinity and becoming a man in every sense of the word, the example especially after having to deal with the oppression of my masculinity from my past relationship and abuse in my family and my life, to no longer be a slave, SOVEREIGNTY.
* Becoming militant in my discipline, a sayer in every sense of the word.
#### From overcoming these things what have you accomplished and/or are moving toward accomplishing?
**Accomplished:**
* Developed an amazing character of a human being and man to the point where women call me the 1%
* Survived being a black man, no jail, drugs, children, addictions, and my mental health is in a much improved position from the survivor mindset
* Gone through the therapy and work of the trauma of my childhood, sexual abuse, parental abuse, and emotional abuse from women
* As a neurodivergent man I am doing very very very well holding myself together.

**Accomplishing/In-Progress:**
* Developing my voice, brand, and skills as an independent artist/designer, and speaker/influencer
* Reconditioning of my mind for success and sovereignty in all areas of my life
* Moving full force into the world of fine arts on both sides of creation and consumption
* Carrying the Ummah with the 9% of other men through the results of our production and character as the example for the other 80% of men
* Bringing forth the issues of the Ummah, black community, men, and women, marriage/dating so that the work can be done to begin solving
* Becoming an expat to a country in the east to start a new life
* Plugging into the US and BRICS financial systems
* Building my body and mind to match the strength of my heart and character, to be a professional human being
* Preparing myself to take on a family with multiple wives outside of the west while maintaining my sister and mother
* Complete digital income and time freedom as creator and knowledge worker, a synthesizer, a modern day renaissance man
* Creating a brotherhood of men that I lead and are moving toward the same direction as I
#### In overcoming your challenges and the accomplishments you have achieved, who would your story speak to?
* Men and women dealing with the trauma of abuse be it emotional, mental, physical, and/or sexual
* Muslim and traditional men preparing and/or getting themselves together as men who lead and take care of multiple families and their community
* Black and/or Muslim men who are lost and willing to learn to care for themselves, have standards, and returning to greatness by making moves and improving their personal image
* People looking to relocate for a better life to the East from the West
* Muslim and traditional women who value family and have fears and concerns about getting into marriage
* Creatives and self-taught artists looking to go independent and break into the art industry
* Anyone seeking sovereignty, they have recognized the failure of the western society and see the writing on the wall to bounce.
#### How can you help those people with what you have learned or are currently learning from your own challenges?
* Teach women about who men are and how to work with us for marriage
* Educate other Muslims on how to perfect their character, especially the men
* Document a blueprint for sovereignty and how to live this way as I do it in real time
* Educate and speak on the issues of men while creating safe spaces for them to exist and be men speaking amongst ourselves bringing back the boys clubs of old
* Teach others how to live well and manage their mental health after trauma with writing
* Creating art and exhibits to reveal the truth of men and other social issues in ways that the rest of the world will be devastated by
* Creating a platform for Muslimah to speak on the issues of the Ummah to have their voices taken seriously
* Documenting my way forward as an artist building from the ground up
* Teach men how to communicate and how to listen when dealing with women
* Teach others about branding and marketing and business preparation and money
#### What do you want to be known for after you have died?
* Being the voice and the example of what it is to be a good healthy expressive man among men, full masculinity in all areas
* Saving the lives of millions of traumatized and depressed men from suicide.
* World renowned artist with an indelible style and rebellious voice around the issues and concerns of men and the world we maintain and belong to and for telling the truth of the oppressed throughout history and the present
* Being the change in Muslim culture, a man who stood as an example and educator on the women are meant to be treated and how we as men must behave, separating from the negative aspects of culture
* Leaving a well-documented blueprint and example for how men are to live, grow, and achieve in this world we live in with video as my primary means of delivery.
* Giving the men of the 9% permission to be visible, known, and outspoken for the Muslimah carrying the whole of the Ummah on their back under my leadership and guidance
* Living as a man of his word, who never sacrificed his character for anything!
#### What are the stories that you tell yourself and have living in your head that are currently holding you back?
* If I don't present myself well enough I am not worthy of speaking or showing up in the world
* My environment has a say in what I can and cannot accomplish
* The same old story of not being good enough, so why even show up
Now, let’s be sure to get clarity on who the people are that can benefit from your life by grouping them.
### The People
#### Who’s Benefiting
Refer to the question about who your story would speak to in the [[SOS 1445-1446 Legacy#The Journey|journey section]] above.
* Male survivors of sexual abuse.
* Muslim men preparing themselves to take on the Islamic responsibilities of a family.
* Black men seeking to become righteous men no longer impacted by their upbringing.
* Traditional women who want to better understand men for the sake of marriage.
* Nomadic capitalists creating a life of sovereignty in the East
* Self-taught artists entering the world of fine arts
#### Audience Refined
Let's get crystal clear on the categories of people we are working for in building our legacy. Think how you can consolidate the people into a single description to maximize the amount of people your work will effect for your legacy.

**The Groupings**
* The responsible silent Muslim man who wants to protect and stand for the voices of the Muslimah and are too afraid to do so, the 9%.
* New Muslim black men who desire brotherhood, family, and a sovereign life in the East after recovering from sexual abuse.
* Black male Muslim visual artists who don’t see themselves represented in the blue chip galleries, museums, and popular publications.
#### The Past Self
If you have a few groups of people it's now time to pick one that will benefit the most and/or is seen as a common link amongst all other groups. In most cases who you will now describe will be a similar version of a past or current self.
Everything that you do is with this single person in mind. Describe him or her in as few, but meaningful words as possible.

**Description:**
A quiet but internally rebellious black artistic Muslim revert and survivor of childhood to adult sexual abuse who is desperate to become The Man, self-sufficient and sovereign, [[Seed - The Man|The Benevolent Dictator]]. In order to lead a new breed of men and women.

## Phase 03
### The Death
#### Impact of your life on others
My content lives on for generations to come passed around freely as educational material among boys and taught to young men in professional settings. The information and motivational content has kept 100s of thousands of men alive. Academics make use of my content in lectures and various presentations directed to men and women within context.

Men who have been working through trauma or have recently come to the acknowledgment of their trauma find my content first in their search. The content they find is in all mediums for ease of consumption with guides for the readers based on what they want to accomplish. Each person who connects to the content is notified and advised to investigate and visit the nearest Indelible Facility to get service’s specific to their challenges as a man. Alternatively, all users have access to the online and in-person community as part of maintaining access to the deep content.

The brotherhood online also extends into geographical chapters around the world and across languages. Each of these satellite locations have facilitators, educators, and mentors on site. The design of these spaces are dedicated to righteous manhood and wholistic masculinity with various resources, material, tools, and facilities to develop and train men. 

My artwork from commercial to fine is held as a symbol for the beauty of masculinity. The exhibits continue to tour the world and show the dark and light sides of what it is to be a man from our pains to our gains. Giving men a sense of belonging, a reminder that they are worthy of being and not just mere bots to serve others. How they feel is important, and must matter, and must be respected. The works across mediums stand as a rebellion against the status quo and always focuses on the issues of men and the world we live in through the lens of a "black" man
#### How the people saw you
An artist, an activist, a healer, a guide, a speaker. One who gave direction for men and a blueprint to follow in order to live a fulfilling existence in the world. The example for men to model and for women to follow — an educator of the masses, one for the history books. Touring regularly holding talks, meet & greets, workshops, and guidance for men and women just like the Prophet (PBUH) did in hearing the women and children.

A man of the people who lived his word and designed his reality.
#### Remnants of your work
My works are prized pieces for collection and take permanent hold in galleries and museums around the world with other upcoming artists. A deep impact has been left in our digital culture through digital art as well. Be it NFTs or physical replicas of pieces I have created. 

Masculinity and mens health are now a subject of great importance around the world with systems and services created to help men embrace and thrive in their expressions of masculinity. A Rights of Passage has been returned for our boys with proper guidance and mentorship into manhood. 

My publications and documentation are accessible to the public online with some core archives held by my lineage for future use and licensing. The garden of my life's work is made public online, an evergreen forest of impact and stand again the evils of the world. The accumulated wisdom and insights are free for all, always.

The community of men and women aligned on a blueprint of how to live in order to support family and community. Sovereign in their way of living, apart from the norm of society. The men have ownership, responsibility, and duty to the women's maintenance, guidance, protection, and growth — they never go unheard. United in the oneness of God as Sovereign Voyagers.
### The Works
I'm in *The Lair* my production/art studio a loft warehouse with it’s own entrance and driveway for guests and contractors. A five minute walk maximum to my family home which is not known by the public with a secret undercover/hidden entrance between the home and _The Den_. It is where all of my work gets done, it's my home base where my large scale art pieces come to life, my content is produced with various sets, and my group sessions & one-on-one’s with men are held in private.

My main desk sits in the middle of the space and to my right is my production/creative area where I work primarily alone on various art pieces with room for others to do production work in assisting with my pieces. The space is messy full of paint, canvas, supplies, and various materials to build with. On the left is my design area for collaborations and planning, it's a structured area with black boards, sketches, magnetic pin-boards, books, various tools, computers, and design materials. My assistants, collaborators, and team works on this side of the space with my personal assistant handling the administrative side.

The front area is setup for filming video/audio podcasts and my progress report vlogs. This area also doubles as a comfortable lounge with a snack bar and a hidden transforming gaming space for me when I want to chill. Behind this area is a room for when I need to hold one-on-one and group sessions for guidance with dual entrances, one being from directly outside. My companions, the Tatsu, and some of the other select men I do work with often hangout in _The Den_ as boys time after work. The rest of the men who are apart of my community are on the outside of this physical space desperate and eager for my next touring art exhibit, published content, workshop, and meet & greet tour that they know is on the way.

On the second floor loft space which is 30-40% of the floor area of the ground floor and wraps around like a balcony with a nice area to chill with massive windows. One end is my private quarters with blackout glass walls where I sleep, rest, shower, relax, and all that good stuff with a great view of my works below. Underneath my private quarters sits my kitchen with full eating area for myself and the team. The other end of my second floor is my big window office space where I deal with business personally with my big window video/image projection feature, library walls, and hidden storage. Outside of my windows are beautiful views of nature. To access my office it is hidden behind a locked soundproof room.

The building is my castle, my kingdom, and my domain. As part of my compound this building acts as one side of my barrier to the courtyard of my Japanese-Moroccan-Indian style compound where my children play and my home is.
### The Day
**God's Time**
My eyes open to the dark early dawn outside my ceiling window surrounded by fit beautiful body of my two wives wrapped around me sleeping peacefully. I get up to make Wudu to refresh my state of Taqwa and begin my night prayers. 

It's time to speak to Allah SWT.

I head out onto my grass-filled rooftop turning on the Adhan/Qur'an to play in the background while I perform my Salat, make Dhikr, talk to Allah, meditate, and write my Morning Pages with my pre-workout protein. Once complete I perform my yoga stretches, callisthenics, and cardio with jump rope with deep focus and intensity with one of my wives she loves this time together. My other wife eventually joins me outside to be in my presence and watch with joy and admiration cuddled up under a blanket still sleepy. They do not interrupt my routine, they know better. They simply crave being in my presence while I perform and focus.

**Prep Time**
After my solo run with my mindset audio playlist, I shower and they both join me to ensure I'm taken cared of relaxed. We make Ghusl and they meticulously do the grooming of my skin and hair efficiently. We dress and kiss in great affection in between, then make Fajr ending with Dhikr made on each of their hands by mine. They both dress comfy, their hair natural, big tee, and legs out to finish making breakfast downstairs after some playful competitive flirting and kissing.

Dressed up in my cultural attire for the day's battle I make my way to the full-body mirror to give myself some reminders and loving self-talk in privacy. Then I head on down for breakfast with all my favourite foods made and a my work kitchen already set with my fruits, foods, and snacks I enjoy most. I leave the main house to get my day started, to hunt and to farm.

**Work Time**
I head over to *The Den* to begin my studies of Qur'an & other subjects, documenting with video, the training & development of my latest new skills while maintaining the old. Then I spend the next 4 hours in deep work writing to produce digital content and products for my Category of One business as a knowledge synthesizer.

The last 45 minutes before noon my personal assistant, one or both of my wives sits down with me as I dictate responses to various communications and they go over administrative concerns for the businesses. After-which, like any other day, I have already made my daily income goal of 12k CHF minimum as accessible cash in my account before noon.

**Tatsu Time**
The community especially the boys and I make Salat together then head to one of our spots where we are well known to frequent and eat, if it’s not the village lunch. We have our weekly planning on the how and the where of our next batch of money and conquering is going to take place. Our women are off doing their own thing during this time for the next few hours. 

Afterwards, my wives know to be ready for me dolled up naturally in some part of the home or at a spot and they let me know where to find them. I have a nap after we are done — it’s Sunnah. 

**Creative Time**
After a quick shower solo and another "before you go" cuddles. I head back into *The Den* and painters suit-up like my dad for my session of creative works. The women bring food, snacks, and their body periodically to keep me good during my work. I'm disconnected from the business & logic side of work during these hours solely focused on expressing myself in large-scale traditional mediums and in digital for my next upcoming touring exhibit showing.

After my one therapy session with a client toward the end of my day in the studio, my wives come in to bring food and keep me company at a distance, they miss being in my presence. While I wind down, have my thinking session and then the review of the day they are happy and playful cleaning up my space and preparing it for tomorrow. They know exactly how I like things.

**Wife Time**
We head on over back to the main house with these two women in hand and all on me laughing and giggling. They're telling me about their day. We sit down to some fresh food because they both like to cook and bake.

They get ready for bed so they do their thing and themselves nice for me to come to sleep with. Just little gowns nothing under and soft sweet smelling skin. We watch a movie or show lounging or just cuddle & chill, touching, whatever I want. They just love getting my attention and playfully competing for it.

My spaces are reset and I have completed my nightly recordings before preparing for bed.

**God’s Time**
Ghusl is made, prayers with Dhikr, and the reading of Qur'an. After this I perform my meditations for the night and spending time speaking to Allah in the prayer room in pure gratitude and submission alone. Once complete, I join them in the bed where lots of kisses and cuddling is done to me. Again, they like to compete with each other for my affection in a playful way.
 
This is how I fall asleep with clear intent for when I wake, and two amazing women at my side.
