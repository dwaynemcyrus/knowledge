**Notes from Charales** 

  

Responsible is ability to respond

  

Advise is cheap

  

Elder vs elderly

  

Wisdom vs knowledge

  

Elderly wisdom

  

Your can’t be irresponsible and live I. A survivor mindset

  

Your are responsible or irresponsible there’s no out

  

Irresponsible is when people look to blame you not when you are being responsible 

  

  

Healing can be so hard when your inner self wants love your teen self wants revenge and current self want peace
