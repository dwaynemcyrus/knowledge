06:47-07:10 wake and get myself ready, brushed teeth and changed clothes. No salat…pitiful and sad

07:10-08:45 got breakfast ready for everyone, got Aiyana food ready for school, got accused of having some women in my phone, aggressively spoken to by Souen after I shared my experience of Basel and Toronto when it comes to manners on public transit

08:45
Now I am just walking to take Noah to his dentist appointment hmmm … I don’t like the state of my life…I am grateful, though I am not behaving in gratitude towards Allah.

This is not right.
