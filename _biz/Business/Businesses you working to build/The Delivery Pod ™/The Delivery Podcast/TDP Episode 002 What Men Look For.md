Today we have…
- a story from a…(describe the writer)
- and of course our lesson…(read the lesson title)

#### Overview
Before we jump into who men are we need to get on the same page about men and women being different, otherwise nothing else I tell you will be effective.
#### Core Points
Feminine beautiful inspiration 


Feminine
We seek women who have been raised to be wives and at the least posses the qualities of one.
- Submissive Cooperative and non-combative
	- We don't want to argue with you, we are meant to lead and expect that you understand you are meant to follow
	- Your co-coperation shows trust and doesn't make our role more difficult than it needs to be and that role is to lead you
	- We seek peace from you ladies, as our world and lives as men are very chaotic and stressful, you are meant to be our place of rest
- Your speech is very important
	- Aggressive tones and delivery indicates to us combat and makes up uncomfortable as no man desires combat with a women it goes against our nature
	- Life and death comes from your words ladies so we look for women who know how, what, and when to speak this the core intelligance we seek in a woman
	- As men we often expereiceor have witnessed the dangerous ramification of a woman who didn't understand the power of her tongue or understood it and used it for selfish gain, men's lives get lost in the extremes as a result
- Nurturing character
	- We seek women who will be good wives and mothers to our children and that is grounded in being nurturing
	- Cooking, yes ladies food. Can you make from scratch without Google are you diversified in the craft. 
	- We as men want to be fed and to know that you are capable of feeding children and others
	- Caring for your home and those in it. This indicates to us your level of selfishness and ability to care for a home
	- Yes, as men we want women who are nesters, because it gives us clarity and focus on what ans how to protect which is a big driving force in our daily lives

Beauty
Men's attraction scale is not vertical in the way you ladies look at beauty and fitness, its wide.
- Natural beauty in the face
		- No body likes to be lied to and makeup that changes your natural appearances rather then enhancing is a lie. Unfortunately we as men have allowed for it to go way too far and unchecked
		- The fake eyelashes look goofy to us and the majority of men laugh at it, ladies it looks stupid and clown-like
		- Yes, ladies we can see the difference in your skin tone from the neck up, and the majority of us are far to kind and call it out
		- We do look at how your skin is maintained and whether the of foundation is being applied
		- Wigs and weaves and extensions are a big no no ladies, we want to see you, we want to know that we attracted to the same women we would wake up to
		- we love natural hair ladies
- Quick note on the nails, we notice them and the claws are ridiculous and we see them as highly impractical
	- Natural is best, it's also a healthier for your nails if you find they break easily
	- Natural nails that are well kept similar to your face and hair tells us about you discipline for self care, think investment
- Here's some encouragement to stay away from the makeup as much as possible: 
	- Clogged Pores
	- Untimely Aging
	- Dry or oily skin
	- Breakouts
	- Allergic reactions
	- Colour changes
	- Eye infections
	- Encouraging cancerous cells
- Natural bodies ladies
	- The BBLs and other false body parts like lip fillers are unnatural, and yes we can tell and we don't like them
	- Men we still sleep with women like this and give their IG photos a like and comment but they will not marry these types of women
	- Men understand natural weight gain and fluctuation and are far less critical than you think under the condition that you are not letting yourself go
	- Stretch marks blemishes, men have no problems with these things
	- As men we care that you are keeping yourself in shape and healthy for your body type and yes we will always prefer the smaller version of you that is maintainable

Inspirational
- You believe in where we are going in life and find ways to support the mission, your admiration is powerful
- Your ability to conduct yourself like a lady and navigate conversations with people 
- Purity and innocence, pulls on our natural desire to give, show, teach, in short become everything possible for you 
- Yes a large compenent of this is how you dress, men do not want a woman who looks like shes for sale or available to other men
- Exclusivity, a woman who other men haven't had access to or cannot get access to is major boost to our status as men

#### Summary
What we have just covered is a baseline of what good responsible marriage minded men look for. Women who are pure who haven't taken on much damage from the world, natural and modest in how she presents herself to the world, and most importantly your femininity is at it's highest. You may be wondering well, who are [[TDP Episode 003 The Good Man|the men with such expectations]]? We'll cover that next class.

You want to go the opposite direction of promiscuity and the city girl life. Don't be a 304, don't have a hoe phase.


Story: [Advice needed, situation complicated.](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskMenRelationships/comments/11h1iqf/advice_needed_situation_complicated/)

Takeaways
- This man is hiding from her, fear of rejection, it's best for you to be upfront about how you feel and get an answer
- The fact that you didn't make the effort to talk to her and she didn't seek you out is a good indicator that she's not into you
- Gentlemen you want a woman who has a strong admiration and desire for you, not just comfort 
- Don't put yourself in the friend zone guys its a waste of time, and always hurtful in the end for you as a man
