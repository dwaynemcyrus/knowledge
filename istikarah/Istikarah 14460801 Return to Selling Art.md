### The Direction
*"O Allah! I seek goodness from Your Knowledge and with Your Power (and Might) I seek strength, and I ask from You Your Great Blessings, because You have the Power and I do not have the power. You Know everything and I do not know, and You have knowledge of the unseen. Oh Allah! If in Your Knowledge this action…*

**of returning to selling my artworks, digital and print**

*...is better for my religion and faith, for my life and end death, for here in this world and the hereafter then make it destined for me and make it easy for me and then add blessings baraka' in it, for me.

In Your Knowledge if this action is bad for me, bad for my religion and faith, for my life and end death, for here in this world and the hereafter then turn it away from me and turn me away from it and whatever is better for me, ordain destine that for me and then make me satisfied with it."*
### The Response
**The Opening**  
1:6 Is this the straight path? The Surah is a blessed Surah. Is this me just being reminded of what you have shown me prior? 
1:5-7 This is the ask to be guided rightly. 

**The Cattle**  
6:163 You are being commanded. Stop likening your desires and fears to the work that Allah SWT has set for you. Do the work, let go of the doubt. 
6:162-164 This work that you are being commanded to do is for Allah SWT.

**The Heights**  
7:143 Submit yourself. That is all. No more resisting, run, sprint, move to Allah Allah SWT. Worship Allah SWT through your works as an artist.
7:142-144 You must push through the difficulty and know that you have been chosen by Allah SWT to speak just as Dorothy told you.
