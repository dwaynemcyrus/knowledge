## 1956
So... here I am just in this room fighting with myself because it's my Jihad ya know. Anyway, I have this strange sense of having to punish myself in order to get ahead and that is wrong of me to do as a Muslim. 

Suicide is haram, and to not care for oneself in my opinion is to live in a way that is killing yourself extremely slowly. Yet, here I am.
