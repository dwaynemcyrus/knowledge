### **N.05 — _ek-strakt_ Series**

_“Gradiance,” the new collage series from Michael DeSutter, quite literally came out of the act of play. The body of work reimagines LIFE Magazine color clippings from the 1940’s through imaginative pairing of imagery and color. At its core, the series is an exploration of the cyclical nature of “old” vs. “new.”_

'At this time my drawings (part of my *ek-strakt* project) are an exploration of how I experience everyday life as a neurodiviergent (asd, bpd, ptsd) survivor of adult and childhood sexual abuse. The focus is on my use of line, shapes, and gradients of black, white, and brown to express on a daily basis.'

<!-- My work explores my life as a neurodivergent person who is on the spectrum and bi-polar, while healing the trauma of childhood sexual abuse. I am currently focused on exploring how I experience the world, and the lasting effects of abuse through color and line individually.

I am available for commissions, collaborations, and I will have a shop available for the purchasing of my work. To keep up to date subscribe to smy letters of reflection. -->

If there's a piece you would like for me to further express as a painting please let me know. I can also take requests for commissions or to make a piece available as a print. If you would like to support the project and journey plase visit my [support page](/support) and give it a read.
