As-Salaamu Alaikum and Good Evening, 
I’m calling for Mr. Hassan Clay

My name is Talha Cyrus and I’m calling about your daughter Sakinah, I would like to get to know her for marriage. Would this be a good time to speak?

Questions for him…
Anything I should know about getting to know your daughter?

Questions you could be asked
**How did you come across my daughter?**
I’d say she came across me and has been apart of my online community. I provide consults around communication in relationships and on men. She had called me twice to gain clarity for a friend, the third time she had asked if I would consider getting to know her for marriage. 


I agreed, and she sent my your number and her brother’s. I did not get in touch right away as the issues with my family and me being Muslim intensified. I thought it would hvave been rude unfair to start this while so distracted. However, I stil messed up because I didn’t follow up with her until a week ago which would be about 2-3 months.

Allah has since put me in a much peaceful place recently so I follow up with Sakinah, apologized, explained, and apologized again. I asked if she would be open to a call to catch up. Alhamdulillah, she said yes,  and let me know she had made du’a for me, now after three conversations over this past week for clarity I am speaking to you now.

Tell me about yourself?
My name is Talha, yet everyone knows me by Cyrus my last name. I’ve lived Muslim all my life, but I only remembered Islam and knew of the Qur’an 2.5 years ago. I am the only and first Muslim in my family and they are not happy about it, more specifically my mother.
- I have 2 younger brothers, 2 younger sisters, and 3 older sisters.
- Being a Muslim man is the greatest honour of my life
- I work as an operators assistant at a print production company, in addition to consultant. I used to work for myself as a brand strategist and designer since I was 16, I burnt out during Covid and just before remembering Islam.
- I have found myself giving lectures and giving consults to Muslims on communication and character of men.
- I have made Umrah

Why would you like to marry my daughter?
I was not seeking out marriage, however the best things that Allah has provided me has come out of nowhere especially when I actively choose to not seek it. With that knowledge of patterns in my life, I believed it would be disrespectful to Allah to not at the very least investigate the offer your daughter presented.

As to why, well, our three conversations have good shockingly smooth. A lot of alignment and understanding. I will say that she has been an active participant in my lectures and panel discussions, so she had the advantage on me in terms of familiarity. 

Her desires and wants in life fall in line with mine and what I have understood so far is that it would be an honour for me to guide her through life and towards interests and desires based on her personality.

Also, I attended a workshop and lecture around marriage at the masjid the day before we spoke. I try to look and be aware of potential signs from Allah SWT. 

And no, I have not seen her I figured it would be best to at the least make myself know to her father before that as she is a Niqabi.  

How long have you been Muslim?
2.5 years now.

What do you appreciate most about Islam?
It’s practicality Allah Swt has given use answers and the guide to being human.

What do you not like most and struggle with in Islam?
I struggle with Muslims, they are still human. I struggle with having constant access to a Muslim community especially to live amongst. Also with Salat sometimes the resistance is very strong at times and it becomes a fight. So I’m not always on time, but once I get pass the fight I feel great! It hasn’t always been that way, but it does come up every now and then. 

Have you ever missed prayers?
Yes, I have and I keep track so I can make up for them and repent.

Why do you want marriage after only 2 years?
The plan was after 3 years to begin searching as I would have had all the time to just get comfortable and would have changed my environment to be better suit my practice.

I’m in the process to making Hijrah and AllahSWT presented your daughter to me and in addition she seems like a very strong match man’s compatibility.

The plan is to become nomadic while exploring South East Asia and the Middle East in search of a new place to call home. Currently, Malaysia is at the top of the list as a good country to have a family.

What do you do for work?
Operators assistant at a print production facility.

How will you provide for her moving out east?
Currently building out my practice as relationship consultant, public speaker, educational content creator with the support of a brother who markets people in this industry successfully.

In addition to that I will be getting back into my previous line of work as an independent copywriter and designer, alongside applying for remote positions in the marketing and design industry.

Will you be moving to where she is?
Yes, I will be moving out to her and have no intention of staying in the west.

What’s your plans for the next 3, 5, 10 years?
- In 3: my career as an educational content creator is in place and I have started my family Insha’Allah with my first child if Allah SWT wills it for me.
- Hafiz Qur’an and to lead a group of people who value family and community

Tell me what would make you a good husband?
Primarily my patience and ability to host and have conversation. I have been raised and trained to lead while having learned much if not all the things not to do as a man who has a woman through the examples of others.
