## Email No.02 Welcome
Grand Rising Voyager,

Welcome to the first day of your 6-day email course on setting functional healthy boundaries! 

I’ll be guiding you through this journey towards creating a life without feelings of resentment and going unheard—where your boundaries are respected and honored.

`Course Purpose`
The purpose of this course is to provide you with the fundamental principles of self-worth and the tools needed to implement and maintain healthy boundaries.
### The Problem We Face
```
Specific Problem → The Reason Why They Have This Problem → The Consequence of Not Solving This Problem → The Ultimate Negative Outcome
```
Living with unhealthy boundaries creates the majority of problems in every area of your life. And this problem exists because you were never taught healthy boundaries or had them modelled for you as a child.

Because of this you experience constant frustration (emotional overwhelm) and carry resentment for yourself and how others.

The lack of healthy boundaries—especially as survivors of trauma—affects every area of your life. 

**Areas of affect:**
- Self (ie. healing, discipline, self-worth)
- Family 
- Romance (ie. mate selection, marriage)
- Work
- Social Media & Technology 

This ultimately leads to a life filled with self sabotage, people pleasing, and feeling unheard to name a few. Living in this way erodes your ability to heal, grow, and exist as the amazing person you know you are.
### Our Time Together
I’m going to walk you through everything you need to know to begin living an assertive and intentional life.

You are learning create and maintain healthy boundaries that actually work. And you have already begun the process.

You are not alone in this! 

As a  survivor I know the struggle of having to correct every single area of your life. It’s an ugly and painful process, a battle with yourself.

I promise you, the journey is worth it.

Stick with the work and follow my lead. You will make it through the rough seas of transformation. You too, can live a life where you are heard, respected by others, and most importantly at peace with yourself.

Thank you for making time for yourself to heal and grow. I appreciate you for trusting me as your guide towards an empowered way of living, and improving the relationship you have with self and others.
### Assignment 
To help you get ready for the work ahead I have put together a brief self-assessment for you to take. 

The assessment will give you a baseline understanding of how your boundaries show up in your life.

**Steps:**
1. **Click:** At the end of the email there’s a link, click it.
2. **Get Curious:** Take 5 minutes to complete your self-assessment.
3. **Reflection:** Grab your journal or notes app (why don’t you have a journal?!) and write about your thoughts and feelings during and after your self-assessment. Be sure not to loose this.
### Up Next...

Welcome to Day 1 of "Boundaries for Connection 101." Today, we will explore what boundaries are, their importance, and how they impact various areas of our lives. 

You will learn about the connection between healing, boundaries, and self-worth. Along with why setting healthy boundaries is crucial for your well-being. 

By the end of today, you'll have a better understanding of the different types of boundaries and how they can benefit your life.
### Insights
#### What Are Boundaries? 
Boundaries are personal limits we set to protect our well-being. It defines how we treat ourselves and  how we allow others to treat us. 

> *Boundaries are expectations and needs that help you feel safe and comfortable in your relationships. Expectations in relationships help you stay mentally and emotionally well. Learning when to say no and when to say yes is also an essential part of feeling comfortable when interacting with others.* **— Nedra Tawwab** 

They help us manage our time, energy, and emotions, ensuring that we maintain a healthy balance between giving and receiving. Boundaries play crucial roles in various areas of our lives, such as work, relationships, personal time, and self-care. 

For example, work boundaries might involve setting limits on work hours to ensure personal time, while relationship boundaries might involve communicating your needs and limits to friends and family.

The 6 types of boundaries:
- Physical
- Sexual
- Intellectual
- Emotional 
- Material
- Time

The 3 levels of boundaries:
- Walls (tight: unhealthy)
- Gates (snug: healthy)
- Fields (loose: unhealthy)

Every boundary has a type and level, depending on the situation and the people involved. You are here to begin creating and maintaining **healthy boundaries** (Gates) in your life. To do so connecting with your inner-voice will be vital, it is the only way.
#### Common Misconceptions
Many people believe that setting boundaries is selfish or mean. However, boundaries are essential for maintaining healthy relationships and one’s emotional well-being. Another misconception is that boundaries are fixed and unchangeable, when in reality, they can and should be adjusted based on changing circumstances and needs. 

Some people also think that setting boundaries will lead to conflict or rejection, but in truth, clear and respectful boundaries often improve relationships by creating mutual respect and understanding.

**Consequences of having unhealthy boundaries:** Unhealthy boundaries can lead to numerous negative consequences, such as…
- stress
- resentment
- burnout
- unhealthy relationships
- Self-sabotage
- Feeling unheard

When our boundaries are tight (Walls), we may isolate ourselves and miss out on meaningful connections. Conversely, when our boundaries are  loose (Fields), we may feel overwhelmed and taken advantage of, leading to a loss of self-worth and emotional exhaustion. 

Unhealthy boundaries often result in your difficulty to say, “NO.” 

This causes us to overcommit, and neglecting self-care, all of which contribute to physical and emotional distress in our everyday lives.
#### Healing & Self-Worth
Setting boundaries is essential for healing from past traumas and building self-worth. Healthy boundaries allow us to honor our needs and values, fostering a sense of self-respect and empowerment. 

By establishing clear limits, we create a safe space for healing and personal growth. This process is fundamental to recovery as it reinforces our self-worth by declaring that our needs matter and that we deserve respect.

As we learn to prioritize our well-being, we begin to cure the feelings of resentment and inadequacy in our daily lives.
##### Crucial for self-worth
Boundaries reinforce our sense of self-worth by ensuring that we prioritize our needs and values. 

When we set and maintain our gates (healthy boundaries), we communicate to ourselves and others that our well-being is important. 

This affirmation of self-worth helps build confidence and self-respect. 

Boundaries also help us avoid overextending ourselves, which can lead to burnout and decreased self-esteem. By valuing our own limits and needs, we create a foundation for healthier, more respectful interactions with others.
##### The healing trauma
Setting boundaries is a vital step in the healing process. Boundaries provide a sense of safety and control, which is essential for recovering from trauma. 

They help us create a supportive environment where we can process our experiences and emotions. 

This sense of control and safety is crucial for building resilience and emotional stability, allowing us to move forward in our voyage of healing. 

By setting boundaries, we protect ourselves from further harm and create a space where we can focus on our recovery and personal growth.
#### Importance of Self-awareness
Understanding our needs, values, and limits helps us establish boundaries that protect our well-being. 

Self-awareness allows us to recognize when our boundaries are being challenged or violated and empowers us to take appropriate action to maintain them. 

By being aware of our emotional and physical responses in different situations, we can identify where boundaries are needed and ensure that they align with our core values and priorities.
### Mental Model

***
Welcome to Day 2 of "Boundaries for Connection 101." Today, we will focus on mapping and identifying your boundaries. 

By understanding the different areas where boundaries are necessary, you'll be able to recognize where boundaries currently exist and where they are lacking. This process will help you develop self-awareness and identify areas of overextension and neglect.
### Insights
#### Areas of Existence 
Our lives are broken up into areas that require constant maintenance if we are to heal, grow, and become emotionally sovereign human beings.

The areas are as follows:
- Self-care (ie. Habits, Self Talk)
- Romance (ie.Dating, Courtship, Marriage)
- Family 
- Work
- Friendships
- Technology (ie. Social Media)
- Finances

We oftentimes avoid looking at what hurts us the most. Those areas of life are where we have wide open expansive fields (loose boundaries) where frustration and resentment roam free. 

Acknowledging these areas helps you understand where boundaries are necessary to protect your well-being and maintain healthy interactions.
#### Self-awareness in boundary mapping 
Self-awareness involves understanding your needs, values, and limits. 

By being aware of your emotional and physical responses, you can identify areas where boundaries are needed. Self-awareness also helps you recognize patterns in your interactions and understand why certain boundaries are challenging to maintain. 

This insight allows you to create gates (healthy boundaries) that align with your core values and priorities.
#### Techniques for Recognition
To recognize existing boundaries, start by reflecting on situations where you feel comfortable and respected. Notice how you react when these boundaries are honored versus when they are violated. 

Pay attention to your emotional and physical responses in various situations, as they can indicate where boundaries are tight, loose, or snug—snug is where you want to be. 

Additionally, consider feedback from trusted friends or family members who can provide insights into how you manage your boundaries. This feedback must be taken with a grain of salt. 

Only you know what is best for you.
##### Paying Attention
Identifying areas where boundaries are lacking involves examining situations that cause you discomfort, stress, or resentment. 

These feelings often indicate where boundaries need to be established or strengthened. Reflecting on times when you feel overextended or taken advantage of (neglect) are key markers of where to pay attention and begin investigation.

Areas where you consistently feel overwhelmed or undervalued are likely places where boundaries are lacking.

Overextension occurs when you give too much of yourself, neglecting your own needs. Identify areas of overextension by noting where you feel constantly drained or overwhelmed. 

Neglect happens when you fail to set or maintain boundaries, leading to feelings of burnout and resentment. Recognize neglect by reflecting on areas where your needs are consistently unmet.

 Understanding these patterns helps you adjust your boundaries to ensure a healthier balance—your gates.  
### Mental Model
**Circle of Control** - Understanding what you can and cannot control.

The Circle of Control helps you focus on the aspects of your life that you can influence directly. By distinguishing between what is within your control and what is not, you can create more effective boundaries and reduce stress.
### Assignment
Creating your boundary map.
**Steps:**
1. **Draw a Circle:** On a piece of paper, draw a large circle in the center.
2. **Label Areas:** Divide the circle into 4 sections, each representing a single area of your life that needs the most attention right now. Refer back to the identified areas from Day 1.
3. **Identify Boundaries:** In each section, write down the boundaries you currently have and those you think you need.
4. **Inner Circles:** Draw circles around each boundary that you can directly influence and control.
5. **Journaling:** Reflect on which of your circled boundaries are clear and respected, and where there might be neglect or overextension.
### Takeaways
- Recognize the different key areas of boundaries to better understand where they are needed.
- Use self-reflection and observation to identify existing boundaries and areas where they are lacking.
- Self-awareness is essential in creating and adjusting boundaries that reflect your true needs and values.
- Identifying overextension and neglect helps maintain a healthy balance in your commitments and responsibilities.
- The Circle of Control helps you focus on aspects you can influence and control, leading to more effective boundary setting.

Welcome to Day 3 of "Boundaries for Connection 101." Today, we will assess the effectiveness of your current boundaries. 

By evaluating your boundaries, you will learn to distinguish between tight versus loose boundaries, and recognize signs of healthy versus unhealthy boundaries.
### Insights
#### Healthy vs. Unhealthy
Healthy boundaries are clear, respectful, and consistent. They protect your well-being while allowing for meaningful connections with others.

Signs of healthy boundaries:
- Being respected
- having your needs met
- Feeling heard 
- Taking your own needs and desires seriously 
- Experiencing balanced relationships

Signs of unhealthy boundaries:
- Feelings of resentment
- Frequent stress 
- Being taken advantage of
- Self-sabotage 
- Unhealthy mate selection 

Recognizing and accepting these signs helps you identify areas that need improvement.
#### Walls vs. Fields
Loose (Fields) boundaries are weak or poorly expressed and are unintentionally harmful. Which lead to feeling drained, overextended, depressed, and anxious.

Loose boundaries look like:
- Porous boundaries look like
- Oversharing
- Codependency
- Enmeshment (lacking emotional separation between you and another person)
- Inability to say no
- People-pleasing
- Dependency on feedback from others
- Paralyzing fear of being rejected
- Accepting mistreatment”

Example of a loose boundary setting: 
Saying yes to things you do not want to do.
***
Tight (Walls) boundaries are inflexible and strict, often resulting in isolation or conflict. This typically comes from a fear of vulnerability or a history of being taken advantage of.

Tight boundaries are about building walls to keep others out as a way to keep yourself safe. But staying “safe” by locking yourself in is unhealthy and leads to a whole other set of problems. 

 Tight boundaries look like:
- Never sharing
- Building walls
- Avoiding vulnerability	
- Cutting people out
- Having high expectations of others
- Enforcing strict rules

Example of a loose boundary setting: 
.Saying no harshly as a way to discourage people from asking you in the future.
#### Evaluating Your effectiveness 
Assessing your boundaries involves reflecting on how well they protect your well-being and support your relationships. 

Consider whether your boundaries are being respected and if they effectively prevent stress and resentment. 

Evaluate your comfort level in maintaining these boundaries and any challenges you face in doing so. 

Making these assessments at consistent intervals helps you determine which boundaries are working well and which need adjustment as you heal and grow.
### Mental Model
**The Pareto Principle** - Focusing on the 20% of efforts that bring 80% of results.

The Pareto Principle suggests that 20% of your efforts can lead to 80% of your desired outcomes. 

In the context of boundary setting, this means focusing on the most impactful boundaries that will significantly improve your well-being and relationships.
### Assignment
Write clear and specific boundary statements.
**Steps:**
1. **Review Map:** Look at your boundary map from Day 2.
2. **Choose Boundaries:** Select the single most urgent or important boundaries from each area.
3. **Write Statements:** For each chosen boundary, write a clear and specific statement (e.g., "I will not answer work emails after 7 PM").
4. **Be Positive and Assertive:** Ensure your statements are positive and assertive, focusing on your needs.
5. **Review and Refine:** Read through your statements and refine them for clarity and strength.
### Takeaways
- Evaluating current boundaries helps identify areas that need adjustment for better effectiveness.
- Healthy boundaries (gates) promote mutual respect and well-being, whereas unhealthy boundaries (fields and walls) cause stress and conflicts.
- Focusing on the most impactful boundaries ensures significant improvement in well-being and relationships, following the Pareto Principle.

Welcome to Day 4 of "Boundaries for Connection 101." Today, we will focus on setting clear and effective boundaries. 

You will learn steps for establishing boundaries, communication techniques for expressing them, and strategies for overcoming the fear of setting boundaries. 

Role-playing scenarios will help you practice assertiveness and prepare for real-life conversations.
### Insights
#### Connecting with your Inner-Voice
Clear boundaries are specific, direct, and aligned with your inner-voice. This inner-voice is made up of your values, morals, principles, and beliefs.

Setting clear and effective boundaries is simple and involves only 3 fundamental steps. 

Here are the steps:
1. Identify the boundary you need based on your values and needs. 
2. Communicate the boundary clearly and assertively to others. 
3. Maintain your boundaries, and be prepared to reinforce them when they are challenged. 

Most things in life that simple are difficult to achieve, but not impossible. 

You fail in your boundaries because there is a disconnection with your inner-voice. Connecting is healing and this is most difficult for trauma survivors. 

From today onward you begin to listen and acknowledge your inner-voice. This can also be referred to as healing the inner child—it is the most challenging, yet rewarding work you can do. 

If you hadn’t notice, you have already started.
#### Expressing Your Inner-Voice
Effective communication is key to expressing boundaries. Use "I" statements to convey your needs and feelings without blaming others. 

For example, "I need time alone after work to recharge" is more effective than "You always bother me when I get home." 

Be assertive, but respectful, and ensure your tone and body language match your words. Active listening is also important; acknowledge the other person's perspective while maintaining your position.

Always avoid giving in to the feeling of justifying. This often open a door for a boundary violator to wear you down emotionally and manipulate you into giving in.  

No means no. It’s as simple as that.
#### Overcoming the fear 
The fear of setting boundaries often stems from a fear of conflict or rejection. 

Overcoming this fear involves recognizing that boundaries are essential for healthy relationships and self-care. 

Practice self-compassion and remind yourself that your needs are valid. 

Start with small, low-stakes boundaries to build confidence. Over time, as you experience the benefits of setting boundaries, your fear will diminish, and you will feel more empowered.
#### Empowering Your Inner-Voice
Role-playing is an effective way to practice setting boundaries. This can be done in the mirror, with a trusted individual, and even by recording yourself with your phone. 

Writing is a powerful tool for healing, growth, and the development of your inner-voice. 

Having a script for your communication is always a great idea. It allows you to get clear and be assertive about **your needs** without the influence of others.

Never use the word “because” anywhere in your sentence. Don’t explain yourself, and don’t apologize.

Script example:
"When you interrupt me while I'm working, I feel frustrated because I need focus to complete my tasks. Can we agree on quiet hours during my work time?" 

Everything great was built one step at a time. Give yourself grace, and be your own advocate in today’s assignment. 
### Mental Model
**Nonviolent Communication (NVC)** - Observing, feeling, needing, and requesting without judgment.

NVC is a communication framework that emphasizes empathetic listening and expressing needs without judgment. It involves observing a situation without judgment, expressing your feelings, identifying your needs, and making a clear request. 

This approach fosters mutual respect and understanding in boundary-setting conversations.
### Assignment
Practice boundary-setting conversations by role-playing assertiveness.
**Steps:**
1. **Choose a Statement:** Select one boundary statement (related to another person) from Day 3. It’s okay to start small. Pick the boundary you’ll feel most comfortable sharing.
2. **Scenario Preparation:** Write down a scenario where you need to assert this boundary.
3. **Role-Play:** If possible, ask a friend to help you role-play the scenario. If alone, practice out loud.
4. **Script Writing:** Write a script of how you will express this boundary, including observing, feeling, needing, and requesting (NVC model).
5. **Practice:** Practice your script multiple times, focusing on staying calm and assertive.
### Takeaways
- Clear and effective boundaries require specific, realistic, and enforceable statements.
- Assertive communication involves using “I” statements, being concise, and avoiding unnecessary apologies.
- Never use the word “because”, don’t explain yourself, and don’t apologize.
- Overcoming the fear of setting boundaries starts with self-compassion and practicing with less intimidating boundaries.
- Role-playing and scripting boundary-setting conversations help build confidence and competence in real-life situations.
- The Nonviolent Communication (NVC) model fosters mutual respect and understanding in boundary-setting conversations.

You’ll learn strategies for dealing with resistance and/or pushback. Along with building the resilience and confidence to consistently reinforce your healthy boundaries. 

By the end of today, you'll be equipped with tools to handle challenges and ensure your boundaries remain strong.
### Insights
#### Consistent Reinforcement
Inconsistent boundaries confuse others and undermine your efforts. It tells others that you are not serious, and that you can be pushed around. 

To remedy this you must be clear and firm in communicating your boundaries and follow through with consequences if they are violated. 

Consistent review of your boundaries ensure that they remain relevant and effective. 

Consistency builds trust and respect in your relationships, reinforcing the importance of your boundaries.
#### Resilience and confidence 
Building resilience involves developing the inner strength to uphold your boundaries despite challenges. In other words deepen your connection with your inner-voice, and make room for your inner-child to be heard. 

The best way of doing this is journal. Maintaining a consistent routine of free writing allows you to build a better relationship with your inner-voice aka the child you.

Make a habit of practicing self-compassion and remind yourself that your needs are valid. 

Regularly reflect on past successes in maintaining boundaries to boost your confidence. Engage in activities that build self-esteem and reinforce your sense of self-worth, such as solo dates. 

Remember, resilience grows with each successful reinforcement of your boundaries, making it easier to maintain them over time.

Baby steps are the way forward.
#### Resistance and Pushback 
Resistance or pushback from others is common when setting boundaries. 

Respond to resistance with calmness and assertiveness. Reiterate your boundary and explain its importance to you as needed.

Use the NVC model (from yesterday) to express your feelings and needs without blaming the other person. 

If resistance continues, enforce consequences to demonstrate the seriousness of your boundary. Remember, it's okay to distance yourself from individuals who consistently disrespect you by violating your boundaries.
##### Maintaining and reinforcing 
Boundaries require consistency and persistence. This needs to be a conscious and deliberate effort.

You need to embody an entire new way of being. 

Here are a few fundamental strategies to employ:
- Regularly review your boundaries to ensure they still align with your values and needs. 
- Communicate them clearly and assertively, and be prepared to enforce consequences if they are not respected. 
- Use positive reinforcement to acknowledge when others respect your boundaries. 
- Practice self-care to ensure you have the emotional and physical strength to maintain your boundaries.
### Mental Model
**The Accountability Loop** - Setting, tracking, and reviewing your boundaries regularly.

The Accountability Loop involves establishing clear boundaries, tracking your progress in maintaining them, and regularly reviewing and adjusting your approach as needed. 

This continuous cycle ensures that your boundaries remain effective and relevant over time.

Develop a plan to reinforce your boundaries when faced with pushback.
**Steps:**
1. **Draw a Chart:** On a piece of paper draw two vertical lines to make three columns.
2. **Column One:** Write a boundary you’d like to implement. It’s okay to use one from the last exercise.
3. **Column Two:** Write two actions to help you implement and follow up on your boundary.
4. **Column Three:** Name a consequence that you can implement if your boundary isn’t honored.
5. **Reminder:** Use this action plan as your mental guide when executing and following through on your boundaries.
### Takeaways

Welcome to Day 6 of "Boundaries for Connection 101." Today, we will focus on integrating boundaries into your daily life. 

By creating an ongoing boundary tracking journal, you will reflect on your experiences, identify patterns, and set intentions for continuous improvement. This exercise will help you maintain your boundaries and provide a foundation for future growth and support. 
### Insights
#### Long-term benefits
Healthy boundaries offer numerous long-term benefits, which include reduced stress, improved relationships, and enhanced self-worth. They help you manage your time and energy effectively, preventing burnout and promoting balance. 

Over time, maintaining healthy boundaries leads to increased confidence, emotional stability, and a stronger sense of self. 

By protecting your well-being, boundaries enable you to go from survivor to thriver in all areas of your life.
#### Your New Way of Being
Maintaining boundaries is an ongoing process that requires practice and adjustment. 

It is vital that you celebrate your successes in setting and maintaining boundaries, no matter how small. 

Be patient with yourself as you navigate challenges and setbacks. Reflect regularly on your experiences to identify areas for improvement and growth. 

Stay committed to prioritizing your needs and honoring your boundaries, knowing that each step forward enhances your overall well-being.
##### Tips for integration  
Integrating boundaries into everyday interactions involves clear communication and consistent reinforcement. 

The List:
- Maintain a practice of journaling for reflection on the areas of your life where you feel unheard or used.
- Communicate openly about your needs and boundaries with those close to you.
- Practice assertiveness in expressing your needs and limits. 
- Be mindful of your body language and tone to ensure your message is received effectively. 
- Use active listening to understand others' perspectives while staying true to your boundaries. 
- Set clear expectations and enforce consequences when boundaries are violated.
- Practice self-care to nurture your physical, emotional, and mental well-being.
- Seek support from friends, mentors, or coaches (yes, that includes me) who have your best interest at heart—not theirs. 
### Mental Model
**The Feedback Loop** - Reflecting on successes and areas for improvement.

The Feedback Loop involves continuously gathering and reflecting on feedback to improve and adapt your behavior and strategies. By regularly assessing your boundary-setting efforts, you can identify what's working and what needs adjustment, leading to ongoing personal growth.
### Assignment
Create an ongoing boundary tracking journal.
**Steps:**
1. **Set Up Your Journal:**
	- **Materials Needed:** A notebook or a few sheets of paper, and a pen. Or a digital equivalent—I’m looking at you iPad users. 
	- **Sections:** Divide your journal into daily or weekly entries.
2. **Daily/Weekly Reflection:**
	- **Identify Boundary Needs:** Each day or week, write down any situations where you felt a boundary was needed. Be specific about the context and why you felt this way.
	- **Track Boundary Violations:** Record any instances where your boundaries were violated. Describe what happened, how it made you feel, and the impact on your well-being.
	- **Emotional Response:** Reflect on your emotional responses to these situations. Note any patterns or recurring feelings.
3. **Analyze Patterns:**
	- **Review Entries:** At the end of each week, review your entries to identify patterns or common themes in boundary needs and violations.
	- **Identify Areas for Improvement:** Note areas where you struggle to set or maintain boundaries and consider why these areas are challenging.
4. **Set Intentions:**
	- **Weekly Goals:** Set 1 goal—remember, baby steps—for the upcoming week to improve your boundary-setting skills. These could include practicing assertive communication, reinforcing existing boundaries, or addressing specific situations.
	- **Action Steps:** Outline specific actions you will take to achieve these goals.
5. **Regular Check-Ins:**
	- **Schedule Time:** Dedicate time each week to review your journal and assess your progress. Adjust your goals and action steps as needed.
### Takeaways
- Healthy boundaries improve relationships, mental health, and self-respect.
- Consistency and clear communication are key to integrating boundaries into daily interactions.
