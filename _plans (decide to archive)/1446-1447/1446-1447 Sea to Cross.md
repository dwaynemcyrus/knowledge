Goal
By 12 Shaban 1447 (31 January 2026) I will have a monthly recurring income of 240,000 CHF that will come to me in ever-increasing amounts during the interim. In return for this money, I will give the most sufficient service to which I am capable of rendering to the fullest possible quantity and the best possible quality of service in the capacity of illustrated storytelling, and communal guidance. This is my path forward. With absolute trust in Allah SWT, I now see this money before my eyes. I can touch it with my hands. It is now awaiting transfer to me at the time and in the proportion that I deliver the services I am rendering in return for it. I am awaiting the plan by which to accumulate this money, and I will act on that plan when and as it is revealed to me by Allah SWT.

Ya Allah, I am committing myself to the work of the goal above, please [[Ask 14460926 Sea to Cross 1446-1447|confirm that this is good for me]] for the last time. 

Oath
