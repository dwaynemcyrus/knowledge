## 2310
My brothers and elders told me to write a series of love letters to myself. 

Here I am writing it and it feels odd. I am uncomfortable, and I do not like the feeling. What does a love letter even look like anyway? 

I really do not know, but I will give it my very best efforts.

So, I wrote my letter of love to myself, it was weird.

Very weird, but I did it.

So now what? Now I push this week's newsetter out into the world.
