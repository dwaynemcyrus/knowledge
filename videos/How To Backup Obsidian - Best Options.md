## Introduction
- iCloud, Google Drive, DropBox are not backup solutions, these are cloud syncing solutions
- It's best to have the cloud solution and a backup solution, most people only have a cloud solution
## Cloud Sync vs Real Backups
**Cloud Sync**:
- The only purpose is to sync your data across machines
- If you delete a note, it gets erased across all devices
**Backup:**
- Is not connected to your working vault can be cloud or local based
- If you delete a note it is not affected
- File version control is great for having backups that are timestamped
## All Apple Workflow
- iCloud is the best and very convenient
- Obsidian sync is a great alternative as well
