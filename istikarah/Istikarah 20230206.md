**Today Istikarah** 

  

Allah please guide me with this money thing I do not know what to do… please ya Rabb! I need to be self-sufficient…

  

Open 53:13 I don’t know but is this you reassuring me that I am being seen ? // 8-17 Ya Allah… I do not know something with Gibril help me understand what you are telling me 

  

First 36:24 there’s something I’m clearly doing wrong…obviously, look at my state of being // 20-28 Follow the people who are not seeking payment? Is this in reference to the move to New York? Help me understand…what am I to do 

  

Second 27:74 so you know what’s in my heart and what I say, and the same to others…still do not understand // 69-77 Something is close… I don’t know what, but something fair… don’t fall into dispair, okay got it. Have gratitude and show it for what you have been given. Is this my skills and abilities ? But still Allah… 

  

Third 52:4 What house ??? // 1-8 I don’t know, but what I am coming to understand is that there’s a guidance for me happening somewhere somehow I meant to follow . Are you referring to the two programs I am signed up for HU and MM along with guidance from Beki? 

  

Close 8:39 Fight my own desires… the wrong doings… Allah give me more? // 37-41 Ua Rabb I don’t understand who am I fighting, myself? My environment?
