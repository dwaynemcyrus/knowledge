Summary: On a stormy city night, a boy on the run and a fragile, battered creature meet by chance at a waterway’s edge. Both haunted by fear and exhaustion, a chance meeting may save each other’s life.

The rain fell in sheets, relentless and cold, hammering against the stone walls of the city. He sat at the edge of a broken waterway, where the city’s waste spilled into the black river. His knees were drawn tightly to his chest, his eyes fixed on the swirling water below.

The night was loud—too loud. Rain pattered against the water’s surface, and the city’s distant hum buzzed like a swarm. Above it all, he could hear their voices.

One barked,,“Check over there!”

“He’s not getting far!” another shouted.

He squeezed his arms tighter around himself, willing his tiny body to disappear into the shadows. He couldn’t go back. Not to that place.

Thunder rolled overhead, masking the footsteps around him. Maybe they were moving away, maybe they weren’t? He couldn’t tell. Every noise became a threat. Every shadow stretched too long.

The water rippled below, dark and endless, offering no reflection. Just like him.

And then he saw it.

From the depths of the outlet, a creature emerged, barely more than a small, battered shape. Its body was covered in dirt and sludge, caked in the grime of the sewers. It moved slowly, its limbs trembling as it fought the current, exhaustion clear in every step.

It was no larger than a teddy bear a child might carry—small, fragile, and pitifully weak. Its presence was faint, flickering like a candle on the verge of going out. Faded red marks glowed faintly along its battered body, the light dim and unsteady, much like a lightbulb fighting for life.

Its eyes, golden brown and wide. Fearful. Raw. Tired.

The boy froze in fear, his breath motionless.

Neither moved. Neither could.

Lightning cracked the sky, and nothing moved. It wasn’t the storm that haunted them—it was something deeper. The world seemed to hold its breath as the two broken beings faced one another.
