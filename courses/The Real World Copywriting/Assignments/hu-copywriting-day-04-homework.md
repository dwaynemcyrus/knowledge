## Avatar
### Name, age and face. This makes it much easier for you to imagine them as a real, individual person.
Andy Kovurus, 38 years old first generation. Slick short hair, brown eyes, average build with a small belly, and slightly unhealthy look to the face from stress.
### Background and mini life history. You need to understand the general context of their life and previous experience.
Went to college graduated and worked a few positions at small companies and eventually landed his job at a big creative firm writing copy. Family oriented and driven with a wife at home and his first child on the way. Coming from an immigrant family he well equipped for hard work. The world of fitting into the American life while holding to his cultural roots has been a challenge.
### Day-in-the-life. If you can get a rough idea of what the average day in their life looks like you will be able to relate more easily to them.
Wakes up not too much before he has to get up to get ready for work. Often he lays in bed in a state of slight excitement and hope overshadow by dispair and unease for another day battling the need to get more done. Once he is up the first thing he does is drink coffee to boost his energy.

His dress is very average a common everyday suit for work with the same route on the subway going to the inner city to get to work. Often grabbing some sort of unhealthy breakfast from the cafe just outside the workplace. His days is pretty much the same with his hope of a more fulfilling work and a boss who is constantly on top him to crank out more and more work.

Riding the same morning route back after work, crammed into the train filled with other work-a-day folk making their way out of the city and to their homes. He often looks around seeing men who look just like him, tired, miserable, unhappy. Thinking to himself, "I'm better than this, much better than this, if only i can focus more". This thought often gets him pretty worked up during the rest of the ride that he spends and extra 10-15 minutes a block outside his home just to sit and smoke.

When he finally gets in his wife usually not there, out with the girls or her mother. No food made so he just cracks a beer and sits in-front of the TV for a bit. He often tells himself "I'll get to work after just one show", usually three goes by before he starts typically aligning with his wife's return to slap some sort of food together. 

After he's eaten he drags himself to his makeshift office on the kitchen counter to begin to work. Often hit with moments of inspiration and visions of the future success quickly fading into nothing as his focus and clarity plummets. Some work gets done, but only between the endless distractions and busy work so that he feels like he has accomplished something.

- An increase in attention span for whatever it is they are focused on with greater ease
- "Absolutely true! What an impact living in the digital age has on us, how we completely succumb to social media, in whatever form, for me personally I refrained from using my phone for 2 weeks, my focus was clearer, my perception, my mood improved and sleep also improved immensely, I read more books, and cognitively in this disconnection process felt so much more in tune with the real world, we have become much too dependent on social media etc, it distracts us from the present. Although there are advantages, the disadvantages are also important and need to be addressed in order to fully understand how our thinking is derailed via as he puts it overstimulation. It is highly addictive, dopamine hits but there is a certain freedom without it, or at least using it less."

But truly you are only missing out on life if you are held in a state kf believe that you are missing out."*
- *"It's so true 8 days of reset and feeling mentally healthier . The problem for me is getting to 1 day without toxic and stress. Even if I could get 1 day of positive and positive life issues with resolve and all the work I've put towards my issues worked out and showed some positive out comes.. When this positive actions take place the energy and motivation is a level that provides a energy level that is unreal.
