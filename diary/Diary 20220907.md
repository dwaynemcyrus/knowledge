**September 7**

  

  

  

@O534 here I am unfocused unmotivated, yesterday I lightly expressed that I was depressed and my mother just said who cares you can’t be she has a house to build.

  

That’s a fucked up response! I’m just a source of money for her, that’s all she cares about while she continues to purchase more useless ornaments to fill what’s suppose to be a home for Destiny. But she’s taken over every single fucking ounce of it with things! It’s a damn museum in here. 

  

Good. 

  

Be angry. 

  

Change your circumstance.

  

You must leave again because this is a bullshit situation. Even you Nova saw your situation as F’d up.

  

- Define what a success man is and make a master plan around this [https://youtu.be/DIyMJ7_chSo](https://youtu.be/DIyMJ7_chSo)
- Take notes on the book you read with Nova yesterday 
- Write your code while adding the rules from 
- Write a quick draft outline of your book for the ladies
- Complete all of yesterdays tasks

  

@1814 I am now up after being down for however long which is disgusting and horrible and NOT what Cyrus the Righteous, The Exemplar does as a man! 

  

Okay. 

  

Let’s change this then good, get up.

  

Your priority today is the following…

- Clear all of your communications 
- Finish the HU and scrape the new resources
- Update the templates for your Obsidian
- Define your money plan what value can you offer the market? Plan loosely to do so! 

- Shower man.

  

This is it! Nothing more understand.
