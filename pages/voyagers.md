They call me Cyrus — Artist. Writer. Guide.

I lead courageous men and women toward emotional sovereignty and intentional living especially after trauma.

For over 16 years, I’ve charted my own path of healing and recovery from the deep wounds of childhood and adult sexual abuse. I would not be alive today if it were not for the invested efforts of mentors, coaches, therapists, counsellors, brothers, sisters, friends and elders during this long voyage.

Now, I help fellow humans like yourself reclaim their life through emotional mastery, functional boundaries, and authentic relationships with self and others.

This is the work—uncovering your emotional blocks, developing resilience, and cultivating your inner strength to live life on your terms.

I only work with a small number of committed people who are ready to face their pain and transform their lives. Because of this, space is always limited and only offered to those on the waitlist when available.

Take the next step. Whether you are a man breaking free from emotional neglect and redefining how you lead and love, or a woman releasing the pressures of holding everything together and setting boundaries that honour who you truly are.

The journey is yours to take.
