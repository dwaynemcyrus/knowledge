@0114 I have placed myself into a state of analysis paralysis because of fear. Fear to act, to show myself to the world and be judged for it. 

Foolish right…

Go and get yourself some food, let’s start there. 

0146 I have eaten and this is good. Now I must get to work on providing myself with **focus** and **clarity** for my life moving forward.

@1925 I am rightfully upset with myself today, and what I did in response was numb myself with stupid TikTok. Why in the world did I do such a weak and pointless activity...

Indecision, fear, overthink....

This is why you did such a thing.

## Connection...

### Ask
Allah I am making circles of my life and going nowhere please guide me out, I am in desperate need. 
Open — 92:9 [[al-husna|Al-Husna]], the names/attributes of Allah, believe in all of it, this is your creator. 

First — 10:67 Sleep at night, fix your schedule, and study your Qur’an the way you know is best for you.

Second — 78:15 This is what you must do to begin to find the solutions and provisions Allah has for you.

Third — 97:1 This your command from Allah, do not take this lightly, act on it today [[2022-08-28]].

Close — 75:30 This is your vehicle, use it, stay in it, DO NOT leave it or stray. All that you need is here, Allah has laid it out for you, it is on you now act on it.

### Signs
Today I spoke to Nova and asked her about myself and she said my Jihad is loud. That meant a lot to me, truly it does! Along with a series of other truths about myself. I need to move forward as Allah has instructed me to do! Do not run and hide from the people.
