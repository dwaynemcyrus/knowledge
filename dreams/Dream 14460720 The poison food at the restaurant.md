I sat at an outside restaurant with a who seemed like a friend who came after me to sit. Something happened with the chef in the kitchen so the friend went to the kitchen to help. After some time I got up and left. 

Oh the problem was poison, someone cut something wrong so food needed to be redone.

I was walking and I think talking…that I saw a tall person I know waking toward me and I said you look like a mob boss, it looked felt like it was [[Curdin]], he laughed. 

Then I went back to the restaurant, the friend was there sitting and everyone had their food. The issue was solved. Everyone was eating…my food was at the table but was something I didn’t recognize or order. The person who knew me said it was some kinda oat thing that was made into a savoury dish.

There was other stuff that happened.
