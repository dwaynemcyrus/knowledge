## Notes
- The skill you start with doesn’t have to be what you do forever, you just need to start and can change at any time
- Do not stress over getting it right the first time
- Do not try to learn multiple skills at the same time, it’s inefficient and slows your progress 
- You need to become focused on the one skill, ignore the noise and distractions, immerse yourself into the skill
- True success is defined by having true freedom to travel and cover all of your bills
- Start with what it is you are naturally good at
- Learn with what you are naturally good at, for you it’s art and writing you have always done these two things
- It’s not about getting it perfect, it’s about getting you moving!
- If you already have a skill great! Keep with the program to learn how to get into your niche and get paid.
