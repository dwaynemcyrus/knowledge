## Can I do more than 1 module per day in the Bootcamp? 
Yes. But understand the higher the quality standard you hold yourself to on the work you do each day the more you’ll get paid when you start reaching out to clients.

## How do I access the next section?
To advance from through the Bootcamp and into your legion you will need to go through 👉｜start-here to gain access to the bootcamp and then view each day's lesson and pass the quiz at the end (example 📝-stage-10-lessons) After you finish all 14 days you will be assigned to a Legion/Unit where the real work begins. Once you've posted your first win of >$300 in 💰｜wins you'll be added to the top secret.

## Where can I find clients if i don't know any one with a business?
If you don’t have anyone in your network you can work with, no worries. Later in the bootcamp there are guides to help you use cold email to sell to businesses outside your network.

## How long before I get my first client/money? 
That depends entirely on how hard you work and how deliberately you learn the skill of copywriting. Generally there is a period of about 2 weeks where you are focused entirely on going through the beginner bootcamp and learning how to write effectively before you join the intermediate section and begin outreach. It then generally takes you anywhere between 1 week - 3 weeks after that to get your sales efforts dialed in enough to land your first client.

## When I should be start emailing people?
Once you feel confident that you can write high performing short form copy for a business you should start reaching out to clients. This usually takes about 2 weeks of study and practice in the Beginner Copywriting section

## I’m young, can I still make money copywriting?
Yes. But more than ever your success will depend on your ability to write extremely well and demonstrate that ability to your potential clients.

## What's a good niche?
You want to work with businesses that have money to spend on copywriting services, have an audience of interested people already, and are eager to grow their businesses. There are three big niches, Health, Relationships, and Wealth. Pick one and then dive into as many sub niches as possible. Follow this video guide to learn how to pick niches - [https://vimeo.com/708352108/2322e19911](https://vimeo.com/708352108/2322e19911 "https://vimeo.com/708352108/2322e19911")

## How often should you follow up on a prospect?
There are only two reasons they haven’t responded. They either didn’t like what you sent them or they were too busy to respond. If they haven’t responded, send them a quick reminder within 24 hours. If they don’t respond to that, wait a little more and then send them another email with a little intrigue. If they don’t respond at all, move on.

## Should I create contracts with clients?
Only if THEY ask for one. Here’s the secret, contracts don’t fix anything. If a potential client is going to screw you over, a contract won’t stop them, If they’re going to pay you well, they’ll do so without a contract. Trust beats contracts every time. If they ask for one, why not, but it’s usually a waste of time.

## Can I post email responses in 💰｜wins?
No. The 💰｜wins is for screenshots of payments you’ve received from clients and screenshots of massive results you’ve gotten for your clients only.

## How can I get my copy reviewed by the professor?
Each Tuesday there is a link to a form shared in the 📣｜announcements channel, the professor selects 5 submissions with a random number generator and reviews them on a live call on Wednesdays. (Hint - if you watch the professor previously recorded review calls in 📚｜resources you’ll be able to review your own copy based on what the professor teaches in the other reviews)

## Should I use Fiverr/Upwork?
Not recommended. Fiverr/Upwork generally forces you to act as a commodity provider and compete with other copywriters mostly on price. Businesses show up there looking for the cheapest copywriters they can find. I want you to make LOTS of money as a copywriter and Fiverr/Upwork is not the best place to do that.

## How long until I'm rich?
Here’s the path. You take about 2 weeks to learn the basics of copywriting. It takes about 1-3 weeks after that to land your first client. You then continue reaching out to new prospects until you have 3-4 clients paying you to write copy for them. Then you keep selling more services to those 3-4 clients and help them grow their businesses. You should hit 10k/month in about 3-6 months or sooner from when you start learning. At that point you can take that extra cash and invest in in the other capital intensive methods of generating wealth. This path requires hard work, constant learning, and relentless drive. But it WORKS.

## Can I make money with copywriting?
Yes.

## What's a prospect? 
A prospect is a person or business you think could be someone you would want to work with. These are the people you are selling your services to.

## I sent X amount of emails but not landed a single client. What do I do?
First off it usually takes 150+ emails before you land your first client. If you have only reached out to more than that, know that you’re just starting out. Secondly, follow the process of getting your outreach email open rates up to above 80%, then getting your positive reply rate up to above 10% and your booked calls from free value to above 50%. If you’re hitting those metrics its inevitable that you’ll land a client within a few weeks.

## Is my cold outreach bad?
If its not getting 80%+ open rates and a 10% positive reply rate, then yes it is bad and needs work.

## Can you review my Bootcamp assignments?
Submit it for review in your review channel and or submit it through the the link the professor shares every Tuesday in 📣｜announcements for a chance at live review from the professor.

## A prospect just responded to me and want to hop on a call, any tips?
Stay calm and collaborative. You’re there to get to know them, build trust, learn about their situation, and “prescribe” what they need to do to grow their business to reach their goals. Believe strongly in your ability to help them achieve their goals and they will too. You’ve got this.

## I really don't know what I should be looking for when I search for prospects.
When you’re first starting out you need to look for companies that have 5k-500k followers or subscribers and are selling products to their audience. You’ll need to find a bunch of sub niches to reach out to, think about what kind of content those businesses would produce to find THEIR dream customers, then figure out what search terms will help you find that content and subsequently the companies producing them. Then you search for those terms and collect the business info from the companies that fit your requirements.

## I don’t like talking on zoom, can I just do everything over text/email?
Not really. You’re goal is to land 3-4 clients and work with them over the course of many months to grow their businesses to the stratosphere and get you paid insane sums to do so. That can only happen if you establish trust and a person to person relationship with them. Zoom makes that happen.

## I don’t understand fascinations/bullets.
Fascinations or curiosity bullets are short bits of texts designed to capture attention and build insane curiosity. You see them all over the internet. An example for a curiosity bullet for New Era Learning Copywriting might be, “Discover the 4 secrets of “change psychology” and how to use them to make millions of dollars”

## Should I reach out to clients immediately?
No. you should take about 2 weeks to develop your short form copy skills to the point where you are 100% confident that you can produce results for the people you reach out to.

## How much do I charge?
Follow the pricing guidelines taught in this video - [https://vimeo.com/704696582/a69f68e7ff](https://vimeo.com/704696582/a69f68e7ff "https://vimeo.com/704696582/a69f68e7ff") (edited)
    
## How do I set up Streak?
[https://streak.com/university/welcome-to-streak](https://streak.com/university/welcome-to-streak "https://streak.com/university/welcome-to-streak")

## What's the best platform for prospecting?
Youtube, Instagram, Linkedin, TikTok. I prefer teaching social media platforms because it allows you to quickly filter prospects by audience size.

## How many people should I reach out to per day?
20-40 until you get your first 2 clients, after that you can drop to 10 per day.

## What's a good subject line for a cold email?
You want to do something short, 1-5 words, that gets them curious about what is inside your message. This isn’t like the normal marketing emails you learn how to write for clients, this subject line should feel like one person reaching out to one other person. Keep it simple. Think up 10-12 different ideas and test the best ones.

## Prospect is interested in free value, how quickly do I respond?
As quickly as possible. Once you’ve practiced you should be able to respond with the free value within 1 hour. The key thing is to make sure the quality of the free value is enough to wow the prospect.

## How do I send over my free value?
Send a link to your Google Doc, or export the doc as a PDF and attach that to the email response.

## A prospect is asking me about my experience. What should I say?
Tell the truth. You are a new copywriter being mentored by an experienced pro. Remove as much risk as possible and lean on the quality of the free value you have provided. Be calm and confident and they will too.

## Is copywriting getting to saturated? 
No. There are millions of businesses out there and only a handful of copywriters who actually develop the skills to help those businesses on a strategic level. You only need 2-3 clients to hit $10k+/mo if you do the work in the Bootcamp.

## "I send my free value but almost no one replies afterwards. How do I fix it?"
If you aren't getting a 50% or higher response rate asking to set up the call after you send free value, here are the things you can do to fix it. 1. Improve the quality of your writing. You need to wow them, Make sure you're reviewing your own work, adding in vivid sensory description, matching the tone and voice of the brand, pumping your copy full of intrigue and curiosity, etc. 2. Add notes to your FV revealing why you did what you did and why it is important to the reader. This is important to demonstrate your competency 3. Test out new ways to tease the reason for your next call. Do these three things and watch your reply rate skyrocket
