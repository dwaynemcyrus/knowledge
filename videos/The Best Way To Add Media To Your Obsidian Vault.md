## Introduction
- Obsidian files don't live on Obsidian servers they live where your vault does
- Remember when you make a new note, a new file is created in your vault
- Obsidian handles media similar to creating a new note, yes images are treated similarly to a note in terms of data
## Adding Media That You Own
Steps for setup:
1. Create a folder called "Attachments"
2. Go to `Settings > Files & Links > Default Location New Attachments`
3. Set where you would like your attachments to be located
4. This process works for audio files as well
## Adding YouTube videos
- Copy the embed link to store and be able to watch the video within Notion 
- Use the [World's Brain Memix]() chrome extension to take notes while watching in the app timestamps for you
## Adding Tweets
- Click share or more and select the embed option and paste it into Obsidian
- Alternatively, you can use [Twit Frame](https://twitframe.com), but this only works well for single tweets and not threads
- For a long thread, it's best to take a long scrolling screenshot using [Cleanshot X] ( )
