Q: I ask for the guidance that I am in desperate need of to take me through the week.

  

24:45 it’s time you pay attention and you believe in all that Allah is guiding you towards and act on them.

  

3:77 stay away from any further sins and acts that are against the right path. Remove any distractions that will take you away from the good you are meant to do and what will lead you to sin.

  

76:25 Fox that sleep schedule of your to better set you up for your prayers. Being up at night is making it unnecessarily more difficult for you to live the way your are meant to. Your morning and afternoon prayers need special attention moving forward. Get started on the qualilauh then naps! 

  

30:19 Through Allah you can begin to live again! Stop wasting away, you know this! Allah is now telling you this, it is okay to live, please no more of this slow suicide. Allow Allah to fill you back up and piece you back together as only Allah can. Shoot, Allhah broke you down to begin with so follow through in the rest of the blessings he has presented you. No more rejection of life! 

  

111:2 The only way to receive the benefit that you seek is through Allah, nothing else!!! No one else! Only through Allah so move in this blindly and confidently, TRUST.
