## Vision
Mini LIMS explores how **AI Design Engineering** principles can simplify enterprise-grade complexity.  
The goal: bring order and visibility to scientific workflows without the visual noise.

## Core Features
- CRUD operations for samples, users, and results.  
- Table and card-based data visualization.  
- Role-based authentication mock.  
- Optional AI-assisted data entry and search.

## Technical Highlights
- Backend simulation via **Node + Express**.  
- Database layer using **MongoDB Atlas (sandbox)**.  
- Responsive UI with **React** + **Tailwind**.  
- Designed for modular migration to production systems.
