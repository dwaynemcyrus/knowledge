How do I love myself?  

56:51 I am astray, and I guess yes there is denial within me about me this is certain. Maybe even some denial about being worthy of Gods love too

38:3 A reminder that I am destroying myself and eventually it will be too late. So, you, I need to begin this stuff now! 

26:19 I am living ungrateful and what I need to be is grateful! 

67:25 I am questioning everything when I should be acting on everything! Sabr… I have become a hypocrite 

3:146 Allah SWT loves the steadfast…the fears you carry about the life you are meant to be living is false. You are of Allah SWT . You are in Jihad and it is needed for you to get on with it! Commit to it, act like your life depends on it because it really and truly does!  This is how you love.

Conclusion
- Return all that is Allah SWT in your rituals
- Act on what you need to do instead of questioning it
- Exercise gratitude and live in it
- Commit to your purpose!!!
