## Summary

## Notes
### Understand How People Work
- Our job is to help people make better decisions 
- Do not take the position of "I am taking away from people"
- You will learn how to red pill people 

### Target Market and Avatars
Who you’re writing to...
- "Whoever impacts the reader on the deepest level wins" - Andrew Bass 
- Specificity gives you power, it allows you to impact them most effectively 
- First Step: who is going to get the most use of this project
- Second Step: define a single specific person you are writing for, add a little photo to your bio, you will be addressing all of your words to that one individual 
	- **Note to Self:** This is similar to running a brand strategy session

#### What to include in your avatar 
- Name age and face 
- Background and mini life story to have context for their life and previous experiences
- Day in the life description
- Values, what do the believe is most important? What do they despise?
- Outside forces. What forces and people have an influence in their life and decision making?
- The power in the avatar comes from being as specific as possible 
- With an established client get a sense of their best existing client, their target market and ideal customer
- **Note to Self:** Dwayne you know this stuff, the research component at least 

### Human Motivators
How to propel someone into action
- These ideas are very powerful and can be used for evil, don’t be evil
- This information can also help you with your own life 
- People take action for two reason, pain or pleasure, it’s our job to use both to move a person forward
-  It’s about presenting a vivid dynamic pleasurable solution that speaks to their pain
- Most people will have made the pain and dream diminished in their minds you’ll need to brighten both up
- The better you can associate the 5 senses in your writing the better
- Looking at Maslows hierarchy of needs, you want to write by walking them from the bottom to the top
	- The higher up you can elevate the focus (to top of hierarchy) the better

#### Running away from pain
- For most humans this (pain) is the most powerful motivator
- “Change happens when the pain of staying the same is greater than the pain of change” — Tony Robbins
- You need to understand their current state and the pain they are getting already/experiencing
- You must ask yourself (especially in relations to the problem the product solves)
	- What is the painful or frustration in the current life of my avatar?
	- What annoys them?
	- What do they fear? 
	- What do they lie awake at night worrying about?
	- How do others negatively perceive them now? 

#### Running toward pleasure
- Also referred to as the dream state
- For someone to change you must present a compelling, hope filled vision of their future
- The vision needs to be vivid, exciting, dynamic, and relevant to them
- Most people are not familiar with their dream state it’s your job to tell them, but we are all very clear on the pain
	- **Note to Self:** This is where your vision strength can kick in very well
- The more relevant and vivid the vision the better
- You must ask yourself
	- If they could wave a magic wand at their life and fix everything, what would their life look like? 
	- What enjoyable new experiences would they want?
	- How would others perceive them in a positive light?
	- How would they feel about themselves if they made the change?

### The Path to Change 
How do you direct them to actually solve their problem now?
- Once they are motivated, where do and how do you direct them to action?
- People have a vision of the dream state so why don’t they just move there?
	- Roadblock Definition: The key obstacle keeping the Avatar from reaching their Dream State
	- Roadblock’s: They don’t know how to get around them, they often just don’t know why and what’s blocking them and how to get through it. If you can solve this they will love you. 
	- Roadblocks have layers and usually boil down to a key block, a single thing, but you will need to investigate and dig deep to find it.
	- Solutions are typically done in an “if/then” statement
	- If/Then Example 
		- Before: "For example, let's say we're helping overweight people lose wait and the Roadblock is they are eating more calories than they burn,"
		- After/Solution: "If you eat less calories than you burn, then you will lose weight"

#### So where does the Product fit into all this?
- The Product allows The Avatar take advantage of the Solution to get to their Dream State, more quickly, with less risk, and less effort 
- Theoretically if you have revealed all of this to the reader, they should know what to do to get what they want 
- **The product is the vehicle that helps them overcome the roadblock faster, easier, and with more fun**
- Understanding this deeply is like giving the reader the red pill. Once you can show them how the world works, you then frame the vehicle as the best solution 
- Most clients don’t know or understand any of this… once you grasp how all of this connects you can truly change peoples lives
- You can apply this same method to step into your own dream state

### BONUS - Time Management 101
How to invest your most valuable resource for maximum return.
- Invest your time well and you will get what you want out of life
- "He who controls his time, controls his outcomes in life" - Teacher
- The simplist way to manage you time is to do the following, this is what all successful people do. Before you allow yourself sleep at night you **must** plan what you are going to do the next day. A simple logical list on your phone or piece of paper is all you need.
- If you don't plan the night before, you allow yourself to become distracted with other tasks, the other risk is that when you do not know what it is you need to do you will get hit with little moments of fear your mind will give you an easy (distraction or immediate gratification) answer instead of the right answer.

#### So how do you determine what to do?
The trick is the Eisenhower Matrix, the teacher uses this and here's the areas explained.
- Important: It makes a difference in your life often leading to money and or significant change in your life
- Not Important: Little tasks, things that just need to get done with little significance, think administrative
- Urgency: There's a deadline, assignment, meeting with a client, paying your rent, etc.
- Not-Urgent: You have today, you have tomorrow, in the long run these actions don't carry any time-bound significance
- Important & Urgent: These are done first and with great speed, the priorities of your work and life that are time bound
- Important & Not Urgent: These tend to get over looked and fall to the way side, they are very important such as improving your outreach strategy, practicing your skills, etc. It's of the very important that these activities are scheduled. These tasks evolve you as a person, and move you forward.
- Not Important & Urgent: Delegate these out to others when you have money, otherwise the only option for you is to batch work these items an to do them as efficiently as possible
- : Scrolling the internet or just browser TikTok doesn't do anything for your life, idle chatter with a woman falls into this category as well. Remove these things from your life as much as possible

The more you can work on the Important & Not Urgent the less Important & Urgent items you will have. You want to have your time focus on these top two areas and to minimize the ones below.

#### Time Investment Plan
- Blockout your time for deep work sessions
- Parkinson's Law: work expands so as to fill the time available for its completion", so if you allocate a whole day to a task it will take a day whereas if you set aside an hour you will most likely complete within the hour
- Setting a challenging time forces you to cut out the unnecessary elements and it also makes it more fun. This can help you with overthinking as well and you have experienced this.
- You can operate in micro deadlines as well to push yourself, but keep in mind that you must be adaptable as you do this because you will win and loose as you figure out your timings for tasks.

#### Stay Adaptable
- Darwin said the ones who can be the most adaptable survive not the ones who are the strongest
- Things will happen in life and a compelling goal will keep you focused while remaining adaptable for change.

#### Morning Rituals
- Most people use this as a crutch, as a way for lesser men to avoid getting started with their work
- Often made or turns into an avoidance technique
- Most people with this ritual are actually afraid of doing the work
- Whoever gets the most work done, in the same amount of human years wins
- Get up and get straight to work
- Better men just get up and get the work done
- **Note to Self:** Your morning ritual will need to be looked at through a specific lens and evaluated, while keeping in mind that you being on a particular routine your 20/80 creates success for you

#### When I'm Awake I'm Working
- An extremely important model to keep in your mind a concept to live by
- Devote all of your waking time into things that move your life forward, that have a positive ROI
- Keep in mind work is just a place holder term and that there are many important aspects of your life to work on like relationships, fitness, health, rewarding pursuits, etc. use your time to work on those things that are valuable to your life
- Do you really want the success, then find your way to manage your time to get them, this is the only way to win!

## Assignments
Remember that Sales Page you analyzed in the last Homework?
[https://drive.google.com/file/d/1q8Y1PKpvrA985L3KE5RosykNn6_gv7Uu/view?usp=sharing](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1q8Y1PKpvrA985L3KE5RosykNn6_gv7Uu/view?usp=sharing)   
  
Start another deep work session and based on context clues inside the sales page,  
  
Answer these questions:  
- Who do you think the ideal target market for this product is? 
- Create an Avatar that embodies the target market you determined. List out some of their qualities.  
- What are the pains and frustrations your avatar is experiencing?  
- What does your Avatar desire? What does their dream life look like?  
- What is the key Roadblock keeping your Avatar from achieving their Dream State now?  
- What is the Solution that will allow the Avatar to achieve their Dream State?  
- How does the Product make it easier for the Avatar to implement the Solution and achieve their Dream State?   
  
There is no official right answer. You will have to use the context clues from the sales page as well as make your best guesses to come up with the answers.


### Example
Here is an example of what the completed mission should roughly look like.
