**Standards for yourself**

  

Never let anyone disrespect you in any way shape or form…

  

I increase my vocabulary on a daily basis

  

Remind yourself “ Believe in nothing but your own strength”

***

**Rules for my inner circle**

  

Can’t deal with women you are sex deprived and makes you weak and liable

  

Struggling with money makes you desperate and you’ll do anything for it

  

Bravery, can’t fight is okay, not willing to fight is not an option means you are dead weight in emergency

  

Loyalty is a must!

***

I don’t do silent treatment so give me that experience at your own risk

  

I don’t do sleep on the couch or you taking my children away with you because your upset, if you want to be apart you go and live my children

  

Do not lie to me
