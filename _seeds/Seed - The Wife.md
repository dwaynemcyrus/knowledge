Below 5’3 definitely not a nurse, psych, air hostess, honestly just not a women focused on career as a whole.

  

Family oriented, she grew up with her family and contributing to the household. She has a genuine love for caring and nurturing people specifically family members.

  

She can cooks and enjoys excitementing with food. I’m just not that guy, I can operate in a kitchen used to work in one and I been taught. I just don’t like it all. However for a woman that will be happy cooking and being health conscious when it comes to what I eat I’ll bake whatever she wants and clean up after in kitchen, she doesn’t need to clean up.

She is conscious of her status and reputation in and out the home. Understands that association with certain groups of people can be very detrimental or damaging to herself and the family. Also I expect that she understands as my wife what she does reflect on my reputation.

  

Cares about herself, her mental health, emotional health, and physical health. So she puts in the effort to stay fit in those areas. I firmly believe in healthy/strong body creates healthy/strong mind. And the mind is what I’m prioritizing in my decision for a wife.

  

A fan of the flowery dresses and into fashion. Flexible enough though that she can be as comfortable in a hoodie sweats as she would be in a dress and heels.

Has to have a strong will of mind. It’s going to be needed for the direction of life I’m heading towards. I need a solid minded woman I can depend on. 

  

She’s naturally wants to be of service and support me in whatever capacity I see fit. If I believe she can accomplish something either for me or for herself I want her to trust that I got her and I’ll catch her if she fails. 

  

Trust trust trust…she’s got to trust me. Without it we have nothing at all. That trust needs to come with understanding, as I will mess up, make mistakes, fail at things.

  

Communication, talk to me about anything and everything. She needs to feel okay with depending on me in all ways. 

  

Has an understanding that men and women are different. I do operate within our biological roles.

- Willing to start over from poverty and homelessness as long as she’s with me

She is all about taking in communication she wants to hear everything I say she wants to know everything else he wants to learn everything that I know every little thing she is observant in the deep study of who I am

  

My goals objectives and outcomes in life are hers, that’s it she’s all about but I want nothing less sometimes a little more

She knows when and where to speak and to be quiet and hold her reputation and honour in the highest offer cards not only for herself but because she is a representation of her family and a husband and father
