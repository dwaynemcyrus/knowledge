I will believe Allah, you are the provider not me you give everything not me. But I do not understand my wealth and how to gain access to it from you Allah. Educate me, guide me please!  

You know I want to be self-sufficient in all things like Talha a giver to everyone and never a taker. Guide me to this Ya Rabb.
