Going to New York this weekend to start a new life as a Muslim and to take care of the family my mother and sister. Is this right for me still?

  

Open 113:5 I need to be mindful of envy? Myself or from others Allah? // Surah this about protection, and there’s reference in the tags it again about Jibrail, is this encouraging of me to gain protection from you with this move?

  

  

First 26:186 I’m thinking that I need to be sure to humble myself and let go of ego and any arrogance within and about myself. -// 183-189 Be very mindful of wrong doings and being a liar l. Do not harm others. 

  

Second 23:32 The sending refers to travel movement, I want to give dawah are you telling me Allah that this will support it? // 27- 40 Be like Musa move in faith that you will be provided for and that great good will come of this even though you cannot see the way

  

Third 72:21 Be mindful of what you say, do not assume to know it all. Which is how I been living with this fear stuff ya know. Like I know what will happen if I act so I don’t act or over think the act. // 18-25 DO NOT HOLD ANYTHING ABOVE ALLAH, this includes fear of others or actions or things leading to inaction. 

  

Close 25:67 Spend your wealth that Allah provides and remain moderate. Continue this! // 63-70 Be of good character on this worth and stay away from your sins, STAY AWAY! Keep up your night prayers!
