## Points of Note  
This book is not about dating or casual relationships with men.

The “man” I speak on is one who aligns with your values and needs.

This can get very emotional, know that there’s no attack on you or malicious intent.

The term “dating” is only used to for ease of understanding, I do not promote or encourage dating for men or women.

The book has been written for all women regardless of religion, ethnicity, culture, and social status.

This book is for women desiring to become traditional wives who work hard and value family first.

The contents of this book is grounded in what works, what is practical, and in-turn is made Halal (appropriate) for Muslim women.

## Chapter 01: A Brief Overview
This workbook is specifically designed for traditional women who desire to be noticed by responsible traditional men, and struggle with putting themselves out into the world. We will further expand on the purpose of this material, whom it is best suited for, an overview of the chapters to come, and how the book will benefit you.

The purpose of this book is to aid homebodies in overcoming their fears and insecurities, to gain confidence in presenting themselves to the world with the right mindset and tools for the job. This book has been written for women who value traditional gender roles and want to find a husband who shares in those values. It is also for women who may feel overwhelmed or discouraged by the current state of “dating”, and still hold onto the belief that they can be married and build a happy home with a caring husband.

Over the following chapters, I will provide practical advice, strategies, and activities to help you overcome your fears and insecurities. All the material is meant to improve your confidence by taking you from not knowing to knowing. I will cover topics such as defining the person you want to attract, building self-confidence, overcoming fears, taking chances, and more.

An additional benefit to you will be removing the false notion that you must find a man. This is wrong. Wives do not seek out husbands, you position yourselves as ready wives. I will teach you as your guide on how to be found by men you truly respect, which in turn will increase the quality of men you enter into courtship with for marriage. This knowledge will help you understand what it takes to be found by the right men for you, the men who share in the fundamental values and morals that sustain relationships. You will also be given the tools needed to get closer to being the wife of a man you admire and want to go the distance for.

Keep in mind this will be an experience. One that will be shared between you and I. Don’t give up, push through the feelings gently, and know that I’m a message away should the book get a little too much. More on that at the end of our work together. 

Let’s dive in and get started on this exciting journey towards being a found wife!

## Chapter 02: Embracing the Desire
Far too often women who seek marriage and want to be the best wife possible are often called a “Pick Me”. This is nonsense. Why wouldn’t a woman who seeks to fulfill the most important role ever as a wife and mother not want to have a good loving husband who honours her.

The point of “dating” which in practice is meant to be courtship for a woman, is to be picked by a man who wants to be a husband. Think about it, then ask yourself the following.

Are the women who call you a “Pick Me” living the life you want and desire? Are they in a fulfilling marriage? Do they jump around from man to man sharing their body, yet never getting married? Do you want to end up like them?

Now, to set the record straight, being called a “Pick Me” is now a badge of honour to you. Trust me, the men don’t see it in any negative way and neither will your husband. The women calling you this are envious that you present and possess qualities that men respect you for and want to protect.

With the jealous women dealt with, we are going to start with accepting and embracing your desire for marriage. As a traditional woman, you may feel like society doesn’t value your dreams of finding a loving husband and starting a family. It is important to remember that your desires are natural and valid, regardless of what others may say.

No. Marriage does not prevent you from having a life as a women, be it a career, money, hobbies, etc. It in fact does the opposite, it improves your life making it less stressful, offering companionship, a man who is committed to your wellbeing, and much more. Do not allow bitter women who are in competition with you for good men, fill your head with lies about men.

Now, being found by a man is not easy, it takes work and dedication, it’s not something that happens overnight. By accepting this reality and being willing to put in the effort, you can increase your chances of living the life you want and becoming one of the few women who achieve marriage in today’s toxic culture.

It’s important to believe in yourself and the possibility of having a fulfilling relationship. It may feel overwhelming at times, but keeping a positive mindset and optimistic outlook can help you stay motivated and focused on your goal. It is a necessity that you begin to believe and see marriage as a positive and attainable reality for you. Your success in our work together depends on it.

By embracing your desire for marriage, you are taking a significant step towards achieving a lifestyle you can be comfortable in and proud of. The rest of this chapter will provide you with the tools and support you need to overcome any doubts or shame you may be feeling.

### Overcoming Marriage Shaming
When it comes to the expression of desire for marriage, women often face criticism and judgment from other who typically do not share the same values or morals. This judgement is often rooted in fear and envy from bitter women who haven’t taken responsibility for their shortcomings with men. Misery does love company, do not be the company, you are better than that. 

You are not of them, nor are you alone in your marriage goals. You have decided to learn, reflect, and do the necessary work to get what you want and need. Their words can be disheartening and hurtful, but it’s important to recognize that these negative opinions do not reflect your worth as a woman or the validity of your desire for marriage and family.

It’s understandable that people have differing views on marriage, but it’s crucial to remember that your goals and desires are just as important as anyone else’s. Matter of fact, it is more important because they are yours. No one can tell you what you should or should not want for your life. You must not feel ashamed or guilty for wanting them. It’s important to acknowledge and embrace your desire for marriage as a natural and healthy aspiration.

Finding a fulfilling marriage can be challenging and requires effort. It is worth it. Do not allow the negative opinions of others discourage you from pursuing your goals. Remember, it takes work to achieve what you want in life just like school, and that effort is always worth the time invested. Trust in your desires for marriage and do not let others sway you from what you truly want. Your happiness and fulfillment are worth fighting for. Pursue it without fear of judgment or shame from the women who try to make you feel less than. 

Act in courage, you have it in you.

### Hard Work and Faith
Embracing the reality that getting married is hard work requires acknowledging that being found by a suitable husband and building a healthy, lasting relationship takes effort, patience, and resilience. It means accepting that the process may involve disappointments, rejections, and setbacks. Progress may not always be as linear or as predictable as you may want it to be. However, it also means recognizing that the work put into being found and nurturing a fulfilling relationship is worthwhile and can lead to a lifetime of happiness, love, and companionship.

Having a solid belief and faith in oneself and in the possibility of beating the odds is crucial to staying motivated and persistent in the face of challenges and obstacles. Belief means having a conviction that it is possible to be found by a man who shares in your morals, values, and goals as husband and wife. A man who is committed to building a resilient and fulfilling relationship. Faith means trusting in one’s ability to grow, learn, and adapt to the changing circumstances of modern culture as it relates to intimate relationships.

By embracing the necessary work that goes into pairing with a suitable husband for the building of a mature, long-lasting relationship. Pride and ego need to be dropped, while being ready and flexible in your approach to problem solving.

Cultivating a solid belief and faith in oneself you can approach this process with a positive, resilient, and proactive mindset. This mindset can help you overcome the fears, doubts, and negative influences that will arise along the way. Stay focused on your vision and purpose of being found by a man of commitment, standards, and honour.

## Chapter 03: Knowing Yourself
As you embark on your journey towards being found by a man of substance, it is important to start by getting to know yourself better. Self-reflection is a powerful tool that can help you gain insights into your values, priorities, and needs. By doing so, you will become better equipped to making decisions that align with who you are and what you truly need and want in a marriage.

If you recognize that honesty and communication are important values for you, you can use that knowledge to look for how those qualities may reveal themselves in a potential husband. Or, if you know that you need a lot of alone time to recharge, you can prioritize this need as a deal breaker and make clear your requirement of a man who understands and respects your need for space during the initial courting process. 

More on that in the next book release. Do not stress, everything you need is already here in this book.

It is also important to emphasize a belief in possibility and acceptance of self. This means acknowledging that no one is perfect, and that it is okay to have flaws and make mistakes. Instead of striving for perfection, focus on being true to yourself and accepting who you are in this moment, knowing that you have the capacity to grow and change. This will help you build confidence and self-esteem, which will make you a more attractive prospect to a man.

### Looking in the Mirror
Self-reflection is the process of introspection, where you look inward to gain a deeper understanding of your thoughts, feelings, and experiences. When it comes to being found by a man for marriage, self-reflection is a necessary action in gaining the correct insights into your personal values and priorities. Your values create the foundations of what’s important to you, they guide your behaviour and decision making. Priorities are the areas and tasks in life that you consider most important to accomplish and they help you to determine how you spend your time and energy.

Self-reflection allows you to identify any areas in your life where you may need to make changes. For example, if you value good health, but find that you are not taking care of yourself as well as you would like, self-reflection can help you to identify why that is and what changes you need to make in order to best align with your values.

By taking the time to reflect on who you are and what you want out of life as it relates to being a wife and supporting a husband, you will gain great clarity. Having such clarity on how you want to be as a wife will shape what you are looking for in a husband. This will make the process of positioning yourself much more clear and less confusing.

### Better Decisions
When you better understand your wants and needs, you are more likely to choose a man who aligns with your values and share your goals for marriage. This understanding also helps you to identify red flags early on in courtship, which can save you from potential heartbreak and future disappointment. The key for you as a women is to disqualify men as quickly as possible in order to protect yourself and this should not be done alone, your emotions will eventually cloud your judgement.

Self-knowledge is also essential in setting healthy boundaries in a relationship. When you know your values and priorities, you give yourself the ability to communicate them effectively. This helps to create a healthy relationship dynamic and avoid misunderstandings or resentment that may arise when your boundaries are not respected.

Additionally, self-knowledge can help you identify your own insecurities and emotional triggers, which have a great impact on your relationships. By becoming aware of your emotional patterns and the situations that trigger these negative emotions, you can work on addressing them in a healthy manner. An objective understanding of your emotional patterns and triggers empower you in avoiding the projection of false realities onto a suitable prospect which can and often does turn them away from getting to know you any further.

## Chapter 04 Defining the Man
“Where are the good men?” a common question and point of frustration amongst many women today. So let me answer it for you. Most are married and the remaining men are a much smaller pool than you have ever imagined.

The pool is tiny, it never gets bigger. Stop believing the lies that you are being told that getting a man is easy. Now if you are speaking about getting sexual attention, you would be right. Now, if you are talking about commitment the common knowledge that is shared is wrong. It is not easy and no you cannot just “get a man”, when you are ready.

These marriage minded men tend to not be seen because they keep themselves busy investing in spaces and people that will benefit their future. They do not frequent the bars and clubs, are not loud and all over social media. There is a reason why you don’t know where to position yourself to be found by a husband and it’s all in your control.

You have never thought about him, described him, took time to investigate who that type of man you desire is as a human being beyond the lifestyle you would like for him to provide you. You do not know what you are looking for and you have not spent the time to study.

This is why many of you have not been able to find a man, or even come close to being amongst the men you desire.

## Nuts and Bolts
Let us delve into the intricacies of defining the man that you envision as your future husband. We will emphasize the significance of understanding what your man is seeking for in a wife. Gaining this insight will enhance the efficiency and effectiveness of your positioning as a wife.

This chapter provides practical guidance on how to identify the important qualities in said man, and how to align them with your own needs and desires. This awareness and clarity will greatly increase your chances of finding a compatible leader who will build a stable, compassionate, and attentive relationship with you.

This part of our journey necessitates a profound understanding of oneself and one’s relationship preferences. This chapter encourages you to reflect on your own needs, desires, and standards in order to properly explore what your ideal man’s character is. Armed with this understanding, you can approach the search with intentionality and focus, increasing the likelihood of success in creating a compatible match for yourself.

Furthermore, the chapter underscores the importance of recognizing that certain wants and needs must align with those of the man you desires. While this can be challenging, it is a crucial aspect of setting the groundwork for potential long term successful with a man. This chapter highlights the significance of being willing to compromise on certain wants and understanding that mutual alignment and commitment are key to the progression of courtship into a successful marriage. I want to encourage you to approach this with curiosity, pragmatism, and an open heart, as it will pave the way towards your future husband.

### He Has Desires Too
Understanding what men are looking for in a wife is a crucial factor in achieving marital success. It requires diligent effort to identify the qualities and traits that men value most in a wife. This entails self-reflection, research, and seeking feedback from trusted male individuals who prioritize your interests over theirs.

Considering the desires of your type of man is critical for two key reasons. Firstly, it enables you to better identify the best fit man by knowing what is important to the man you desire. In turn you can assess if you possess those qualities and how they may foster alignment with his values and needs. This knowledge also empowers you with the tools to avoid wasting time on incompatible men who do not share similar values and tend to only desire your body.

Secondly, understanding a man’s desires is essential for building a solid foundation for a future marriage. It helps you as a wife focus on developing the qualities that are important to your husband and align with your values. This fosters greater compatibility between your needs and wants with those of his.

Understanding what your man is looking for in a wife requires intentional and proactive effort. It will get uncomfortable, it will stretch you. It involves taking responsibility for one’s own happiness and actively working towards the middle ground and acknowledging that you cannnot get everything. 

Seriously, you cannot! 

Yes, men do settle and sacrifice. All good men do. It is not a one sided affair as many women tend to position their sacrifice as. Do not be that woman.

By putting in the work to understand men’s desires, you set yourself up for success, so do not rush, skip, or runaway from this section of work.

### Be in Alignment
When you are seeking a husband, it’s important for you to recognize that a successful relationship is founded on mutual understanding and respect. In the previous section, we emphasized the significance of comprehending the desires of the type of man you are interested in marrying. Once you have gained this understanding, it becomes crucial for you to ensure that your own needs and some of your wants align with his to set the stage for a prosperous marriage.

Aligning with the desires of your envisioned man sparks an intrigue in him to want to discover more about you as a potential wife. It signifies that you value his wants and needs, and are willing to make the necessary compromises to build on those connections.

Yes, as men (even the good ones) we can get very set in our ways, but we try not to be for the women we value in our life. This kind of consideration fosters trust, respect, and appreciation from a good man; making it easier to explore, collaborate, and overcome any challenges that may arise from courtship to marriage.  

Ensuring alignment of your needs and some of your wants with your envisioned husband also enhances your chances of being found and accepted by him. It enables you to avoid settling for someone who may not be a suitable match fundamentally — I’m talking character, not money or status. Instead, focus on building a strong relationship with someone who shares in your morals, values, and outlook towards marriage and life as a whole.

Having alignment with your husband-to-be promotes adaptability and flexibility in his mind, and yes this is important to us men. Compromise is inevitable in any relationship, and when you are willing to align your desires with his, it reflects your willingness to work together and become the lifelong support that all men crave.

Lastly, know that a good man will honour, respect, and make exceptions for you as his woman. As long as you remain loyal and strive to align with him, he will do his part to give you room and space to become and grow. But in order to get there your man need to see you as a cooperative and submissive woman to begin with.

## Chapter 05 Stand Out, Be Found
You cannot manifest a husband or have one just show up while you make minimum effort on your part. It requires work ladies, uncomfortable work, persistent work, hard work. 

Know that all of this work benefits you personally irregardless of the man showing up. It’s an investment towards your present and future self.

When a man has decided he is ready for marriage he chooses from the women around him. This is typically done through word of mouth within his social circles. If your name doesn’t come up as a candidate he will never know you exist and in turn another woman will be the wife of “your” husband.  

You are in competition for a husband against every other women who is in search of a man like yours. Yes, this means the women older and younger than you, are all competing for the ever tiny pool of marriage minded good men. It’s best for you to drop the ego and accept this. There’s too few marriage minded men at any given time for all of you to get one exclusively. That being said if you are in proximity to good men, take advantage as it doesn’t last long, nor does it frequently return.

You need to fight to get a chance at being a wife.

In this pivotal chapter, we delve into the crucial step of being noticed as a homebody. You may have experienced challenges in meeting suitable men in the past and it has you extra cautious. It’s also understandable to feel invisible or overshadowed by outgoing and extroverted women. Fear not, there are strategies to increase your visibility and make yourself more findable by men who are ready to be a husband and facilitate marriage.  

We will explore practical ways to network and get your name out there, while remaining true to your authentic self and modesty. From creating opportunities to meet like-minded women to leveraging your interests and unique qualities, I will equip you with the tools to stand out in a genuine and meaningful way. We will also discuss the importance of exercising patience in your search, and how to build a supportive community of family, friends, colleagues, and acquaintances who are invested in your journey and desire to see you happily married.

Shooters shoot! Make the first move if you get the chance. Remember, you miss 100% of the shots you do not take.

I am empowering you to proactively take control of your ability to attract a husband and this does not make you “for the streets”. It’s time to be seen, heard, and pursued by the right kind of men who can share in your vision of a lifelong and healthy marriage. Let’s unlock your potential for a fulfilling and meaningful relationship. After all, the feeling of love is worth the effort right? So, let’s dive in and make sure you stand out and get found by the man of your needs.

### Hindering the Results
As a woman seeking a husband, staying at home and not going out severely limits your chances of being found by a man who is looking for a wife. It’s not enough to rely solely on online platforms or introductions through close friends and family. To increase your chances of finding a committed relationship, you need to actively put yourself out there and be visible in a social setting. People need to know of you and speak well of you for this to work.

Attending events, joining groups, clubs, volunteering, or participating in activities that you enjoy are great ways to get started as long as they get you out of the house. Being an unknown homebody and not going out can and often does give the impression that you are not interested in meeting a man for marriage or that you already have a husband.

We make these assumptions as men ladies, take note.

Finding a husband requires tremendous effort and the willingness to step out of your comfort zone regularly. It’s important to be open to new experiences and be willing to take risks in order to be found by a man. You don’t have to compromise your values or change who you fundamentally are, however stretching yourself to experience new ways of being holds nothing but upside for you.

As a woman who is serious about her positioning for a husband, you must be willing to take the necessary steps to make yourself visible and known. Being seen around is not enough, you need to have people speaking on the good of your character. This requires getting out of the house, engaging in social activities, and being a proactive member of your community. Finding a husband is not about luck, it’s about preparation and consistent action.

### Increasing Your Chances
The list below is the groundwork for making moves. You need to outdo the other woman who are after your man.

Good men do not use dating apps to find a wife, they are low investment environments. Good men, men of value, invest themselves and their time where they will receive a positive return. You won’t find them on apps like Tinder or Muzz.

**The following are practical ways to get started.**

**Join social groups and events:** Even though you may prefer to stay at home, it’s important to get out and socialize if you want to be found by a man. Joining social groups, attending events, and participating in activities that interest you are healthy and beneficial.

**Be approachable:** It’s important to be approachable and open to building new relationships with people, especially women. Smile, make eye contact, and engage in conversations with those who show interest in you. Take actions to show that you are interested in learning more about them and their interests.

**A supportive community:** Build a community of friends and acquaintances who support your desire to find a husband. They need to act as your eyes and ears and be familiar with your requirements and red flags in a man. They will also tell you when a man is no good irregardless of how you feel about him. This is very important.

**Filter your friend group:** Surround yourself with other women who are married and/or actively seeking marriage themselves. Your single friends will keep you single as they operate and view relationships differently. If all your closest friends are single you will more than likely remain single alongside them.

**Consider working with a matchmaker:** This option will cost you financially, but with the right person can greatly reduce the time required in multiple courtships. They will help you find someone who is compatible with you in terms of your values, interests, and lifestyle.

### Take Chances, Be Patient
Looking out for a husband is a challenging task that requires courage, persistence, and patience. It is natural to feel apprehensive about putting yourself out there and risking rejection. It is also essential to keep in mind that finding the right person is worth the risks of failure. Don’t let fear hold you back from taking the necessary steps to becoming the married woman with the husband, the kids, and the home you can invite your married friends over to.

Imagine the life, feel it, let it drive you.  

It is crucial to remain consistent in your efforts and stay patient, your persistence will pay off in the end under the conditions that you are doing the work and understand you will not get everything in a single man. When you experience setbacks or rejection, use them as opportunities to learn and adjust your approach.

Remember that building a fulfilling and loving relationship takes time and effort. It all begins with being found and your active efforts in positioning and networking. With a positive attitude, consistent effort, and a willingness to step out of your comfort zone, you can speed up and increase the probability of living the life that you desire.

## Chapter 06: Keeping the Momentum
You have done a lot of work to get here, and I am proud of you.

I want you to take a moment and appreciate yourself. Nothing I have asked you to do has been easy in any way. Yet, here you are nearing the finish line of our walk together.

It’s necessary for me to remind you that this will take time. You will need to be consistent, you need to be intentional, and you will need to be compassionate. There will be up’s and downs and it is natural. Trust the process, you have made it this far, you can make the rest.

It is understandable that facing rejection or disappointment can lead to discouragement and loss of motivation. It is crucial to keep up the momentum and maintain a determined and focused approach throughout the journey.

Working on your self-confidence and self-assurance is key, as these are attractive qualities that can help you stand out from the crowd. We will also be addressing fears and insecurities that will and may already have arose with some exercises and how to manage them.

This is a process, and it’s important to enjoy the journey rather than solely or obsessively remain focused on the destination. Keep an open mind and embrace new experiences because you never know where or when your future husband may run into you.

### Maintaining Self-Assurance
Building self-assurance and confidence is crucial in all areas of life, including relationships. When you have self-assurance men notice, and you radiate a welcoming energy that is attractive to us as men. We men are drawn to women who are self-assured and enjoying being who they are — shy or not. This does not remove the necessity for modesty as a key aspect of attraction for men. Keep that in mind.

Having self-assurance means that a woman knows her roles in society and is comfortable in all of who she is and is not, the good and the bad. This kind of self-assurance is empowering and allows you to approach the search from a place of strength, grace, and security. Building and embracing self-assurance is more likely to attract men who are confident and secure in themselves.

Consistency is also important in building self-assurance and confidence. This means making a commitment to take action towards caring for and challenging yourself every day, especially with the tiny things. Being consistent doesn’t mean boring. Provide yourself with variety in the acts you want to make consistent. For example mix up the colours in your fashion or the places you frequent. Shake up the routine every now and then to maintain intrigue and excitement throughout this process.

### Fears and Insecurities
I want you to know that it’s perfectly normal to feel insecure, you are trying something new, something different. As a homebody, it can be especially challenging to step out of your comfort zone and actively position yourself to be found by a husband. Fear of rejection and anxiety about meeting new people are common emotions that many women and men feel. You are not alone or broken.

Yes ladies, we men have feelings and insecurities too.

I encourage you not to let these fears and insecurities hinder your progress. You are capable of overcoming them and achieving your goal of experiencing a fulfilling and loving marriage. Remember that self-doubt is just a feeling, and feelings pass.  

Taking small steps forward and being mindful to care for yourself as a means of building self-assurance is the way to combat any insecurity. By doing so, you will slowly become more and more capable in handling any hurdles that arise. You are not alone in this, there are many women in the same boat as you, and of course my community and I are in your corner.

Be kind to yourself, give grace, take things one step at a time, and keep moving forward with determination and positivity. You are worthy of happiness and fulfillment in all areas of your life, especially your romantic one.

With belief in yourself and a willingness to push through any obstacles, you will always find the strength to achieve.

## The Author
Talha is a public speaker, visual artist, and prolific writer across subject matters. His experiences in life has given him great insight into the human condition and the frustrations we all bear.

As a man himself, having lived an experientially informed life prior to Islam he is rather knowledgeable on what works and does not work between men and women. This knowledge is on display regularly during his weekly lives. His understandings of men and women have been with him long before Islam. He does give great credit to the teachings found in the Qur’an as a means of affirming his previous knowledge and filling in the unknown gaps in his understanding of relationship dynamics.

Being a product of his nature over his nurture, he has learned and done much work as a survivor. This, along with his matriarchal upbringing has given him unique insights into the nature of women. He believes the best way to make use of this knowledge is to bring good men and good women together to create functional families which are the foundations for prosperous communities.

A man of great patience, and refined values you can be assured that everything he does is with deep intent and for the greater benefit of others.
