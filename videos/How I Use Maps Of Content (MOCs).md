## What are maps of content?
- It's a way of mapping your content around specific topics
- Ideas tend to have parent, child relationships, but also, cousins, relatives, etc. this is why a traditional folder structure won't work
- Care more about creating and less about organization as this is the purpose of Obsidian
- MOCs allow for a more natural way of structuring information
## Building a MOC
- The MOC template has a link back to the MOC homepage aka the "[[MOC Directory]]" 
- Here's a functional example of a MOC, [[YT Channel MOC]]
- When searching using the "YT" at the beginning speeds up the search. Another example could be for programming which would be "PG"
- Your MOC will naturally grow as you add topics 
## Upgrading a topic to a MOC
- Every now and then take a look at your Graph View to see when you have deeply connected notes
- MOCs will come naturally and are earned
## Building a home directory for MOCs
- Here's an example of the MOC homepage, [[MOC Directory]] 
- Every day you visit your directory and he adds a highlight for the day (What do I want to accomplish today?)
- Keep all that you are working on, do not delete, just make things inactive as you go
- The naming in his structure `_030 App Development` is just to keep the file tree displaying these at the top of the list
## Classifying different types of media
**Place these symbols in front of in-process file names for easy search**
- `;` in front of article names
- `$` in front of tweets
- `@` for people
- `~` for podcasts
- `&` for books
