## The Ask
I’m going to reach out to people strangers from my network to earn. I need money to earn YaRab, I need you to send me 2-3k CHF in order to get a plane ticket and a place to stay. I would much rather have that money to pay for rent here and our marriage stuff. That would be even better of a miracle in the next 3 days. I need to earn please, I’m going to offer my services of mentorship, consulting, coaching, etc. Please… I know this is the way just increase me in belief and action please Ya Rabb I do not want to be a sinner anymore. I want to complete my Hijrah, this first one. 

I’m going to fight to stay in Switzerland and be a provider and earn 2-3k CHF in the next 3 days, end of month.  
## The Response

First: The Thunder

13:10 I don’t understand.

13:7-13 Remember, this life is a spiritual one. And in order to receive from Allah SWT you much change you from the inside. That means your behaviours and thinking, your beliefs about Allah SWT and self.

  

Time to strike.

  

Second: The Stories

28:80 Believe in Allah SWT and believe in your worthiness, pay attention to all of the signs you have been given. Taqwa right, to act in patience.

  

28:77-83 Geez…at 77 DO NOT FORGET ABOUT YOU. Allah SWT tells you about your piece of the world. Do not seek to be exalted, lead and be righteous keep that in mind as you do your work. 

  

Believe in order to succeed (80).

  

Third: The Repentance 

9:103 I do not understand. Take charity, this I do not want to do any longer, I want to give the charity and be a man. Take care of myself, my family and above all be righteous and do righteousness with my work as the example.

  

9:100-106 

Figure out how you can give charity each and everyday along with Zakat the 2.5% from what you earn. Ask Allah SWT for forgiveness of all your sins, make yourself aware of them. Make Tawbah, change your ways. 

  

Today.
