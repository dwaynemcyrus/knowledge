- Love and affection (1)

These are the answers which is easy, implementation is what’s difficult. 5% of people change after marriage. 

These sisters are looking for another sister.

Brothers
- Muslimah and good looking
- Appreciate the efforts of her man
- No t loud and doesn’t start fights
- Deen 
- Respectful (1)
- Obedience: One Ayat One Hadith, lawful, legal, acceptable she follows
- in Adam and Eve, Adam was held responsible as he is quamah
- Future mother
- Trusting and can take advice from
- Tolerance and flexibility 
- Soft tongue

They are looking for their mother…

Quran and Sunnah when a man seeks hand…
Prophet Musa: strong and trustworthy (Qur’an)
- Strong in all aspects of life: intellect, physical, 
- Why strong and trustworthy together in the Quran, without one you will misuse your power against the sister
Look for a man’s religious background and moral character (Sunnah)
- Salat is your ibbadah, ibbadah the purpose is aqlaq
- Take your wealth give to the poor ward of Greed
- Fasting is Taqwa
- First tezqiah (aqlaq) then the Quran and sunnah 
- The best of man is the best to his wife: your wife knows who you truly are, she knows near everything about you, you can be great to everyone out your house but horrible to your wife
These 4 are most important for sisters to look for.

Quran and Sunnah why a man 

The 4 Reasons why men marry
- wealth can come and go, money is the number one reason for divorce
- Beauty can come abs go 
- Lineage this can be used against you 
- Religious background, hold her tight don’t let her go, fear of Allah is needed or she’ll clean you out, no religious background you will at least loose your children

From the prophet the order is…as a 1000 theory
- Deen (1)
- Beauty (0)
- Wealth (0)
- Lineage (0)

A wife who is Imana to your children, a man 👨 n average spends 20 minutes a days with his kids

Allah created in the best fashion in the Quran…amazing n the eyes of the beholder 

Seek Deen first then beauty you cause yourself problems,  you will marry 
Seek beauty first then deen as if you will reject her when she doesn’t have deen you reject the Deen 

A religious man is one who follows the 5 pillars these are the minimum 

## Phase 03
How do we go about it…
“Oh my father hire him” Quran proof that sisters can ask
- Best practice to send a male/female representative to speak to the interest to inquire 
- Go through the front door not the back, be in Halal
- Sisters “don’t until he says I do”
- Matchupmuslims.com the brother started
- Have family day so that they can eat together and meet

Criteria to follow
Isha harsh get consults about them from the people around them
Du’a Istikarah ask Allah (it’s not Salat, but that is preferred), dreams are not dependable, we base on practical signs, things will get better or worse, don’t allow others to make for you and it’s singular, best time after righteous deeds or Fajr 
Azam 
Tawakul reliance on Allah 

Quran with Maryam, shake the palm tree you must put the effort 


Most important decisions in your life is 1 children 2 marriage…how? Why? 


Computer theory…
Get a computer don’t like it want to throw away
Go and take a course first
Same computer you like it now that you understand the language

Ship Theory
Your job is to get the boat to the safety of Jannah
Islam without no wind or sail
Quran and sunnah ores
Fuel is Taqwa 
GPS Allah SWT to Jannah

Castle theoety
Ladies your home is a castle
How many kings in your castle
How many queens? 


Sisters you are made 3 times higher then men why come down don’t compete 

Thread theory
When she pulls you let go you are the man
Cannot pull both sides or it will break


Strongest man is the one who controls his anger at the time of rage - Prophet 

Start your left..
How to start…
Enter your house, bismillah 
Du’a kiss your woman forehead 
Then you pray… Allahu Akbar (god is greater than everything), which declares for her to follow you 2 rakat 
Have a nice meal that is light
Foreplay is meant to prepare her emotionally, take care of her before you there’s a du’a to protect your children before

Sex Theory
Women curve up, plateau, curve down
Women. Want to shop, men want the sex
Must go shopping first

- men are physical based women are emotional based
- Men look at the big picture, women look at the specifics
- Speak her language which is focusing on the details, go into the romantics 
- Learn about your wife’s hobby and share it with her, and vice-versa
- Allah says whatever you ask your wife to do you must do first Qur’an, you must keep beaut

Respect is earned by looking after the family, when you don’t you are now a male figure and loose Quwama (responsibility ) and that is the king

Ladies when a man ask you give the answer minus the details. You loose us.

- Tell her I love you 5 times a day, words, gifts, flowers, poem, hug, touch, etc

Statistically we need 6-8 hugs a day

Ladies men show their love through physical/material things, her language is emotional 

## Phase 04
Duties and Rights
Khutbah about men’s duties 
Allah will hold you accountable for how you treat her, so focus on your duties

- A woman is a beautiful gift from Allah Allah SWT a trust 
- Allah says women are a miracle
- Women are half of the Ummah and give birth to the other half
- Allah says he created her for you, so you must be grateful, to harm her is to harm yourself
- You will find peace and tranquility in her, not just live with her, she is meant to be a best friend, she lifts you when you are down like Khadijah RA
- Muadah is much deeper than love

Brother follow the prophet who your wife is
- help in the house chores
- Smell good groom yourself beautify brothers 
- The oath you are taking…hold on to her in the best way possible, be good to those who are bad to you
- When you marry you are writing a book that your daughter will marry, always ask yourself would I accept anyone doing this to my daughter, if no don’t do it. Allah says you will be held accountable for this oath
- halal magic is how you use your tongue, you plant seeds
- She is your garden and if you neglect you gain nothing, as men you are the gardener you reap what you sow

Sisters who your best friend is
- knowledge of the opposites
- To be his best friend be like Khadijah to The Prophet
	- She gave when everyone denied
	- 
- Your husband holds the master key, that open Jannah and closes hell fire
- Ladies think twice before you speak to your husband this is how you damage him the most (close fire) you have two doors to shut teeth and lips
- Think of your husbands like babies who don’t want to grow especially after your children (close fire)
- Remember the good and forget the bad (close fire) be grateful don’t take for granted, don’t fish for faults
- Be good to your husbands and you gain all the goods of your husbands deeds, martyr, jihad, hajj, jummah, salat, etc
- 4 things that will open 8 gates, prayer fasting, protect chastity, be good to husband 
- Before you sleep ask him if he is pleased with you (enter paradise)

Another, nickname is to be given to her as a secret

Money is your water
Quran and sunnah the sticks that keep up the tree straight

To harm your wife is to harm yourself

Musta and mohabba 

Allah say obey Allah, the prophet, and your guardian
