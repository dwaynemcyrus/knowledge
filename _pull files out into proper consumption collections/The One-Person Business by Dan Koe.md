- This course is to give you all the answers to **doing what you love and making more than enough money to live a fulfilling life.**
### Who Will Benefit From This Mini Course?
- This course is designed **value creators**. People that are trying to improve the lives of others by consuming, synthesizing, developing, creating, and selling value.
- this is for those that want to talk about their interests and curiosities while selling life-changing products (not those that are focused on only talking about the niche topic related to what they are selling — there is nothing wrong with this, just clarifying who will see the best results from this)

**Who is this not for?**

- Those that intentionally — or unintentionally — seek to harm others through negative content (certain memes, pornography, etc)
- Those that have a distorted perception of money, sales, and taking the impact of what you put out into the world seriously
- On the business side of things — those that are set on pursuing a hyper-focused niche for freelancing, agency work, and other things

- Actionable steps that you can take right now to start growing on social media, networking with high-level individuals, and making your first sale
## The Digital Economy
An overview of the digital economy.
- There has been a big shift in how we do work, and technological advancements have begun to replace labor-intensive jobs with creative work
- During this shift, you may have picked up beliefs that couldn't be further from the truth:
	- You need startup capital
	- You need a lot of experience
	- You need a lot of followers
	- You need a physical product or service location
	- You need to avoid competition and saturation
	- You have to be neurotic about profit margins, operating costs, and supply chains
- If you are more exposed and open to the digital economy, you may also think the following to be true, which they are not:
	- You have to be extremely good-looking to build an audience
	- You need to be insightful, wise, and produce Jordan Peterson level ideas
	- You have to be a skilled writer, speaker, video producer, and have all of this fancy equipment that is reserved to those that have money to spend on it.
> [!tip] Assumptions Are Your Worst Enemy
> If you have not experienced a common saying or piece of advice — **you have no business adopting that as a hardset belief or assumption.**
> 
> Open your mind, test it out, and find out for yourself whether it is true or not.
### The Reality Of The Online World We Have Created
- Why have a digital product and service stack as your foundation of products:
	- They cost close to nothing to create.
	- They can have 90+% profit margins (on the low end if you are a one-person business).
	- They don't have a cost for replication. Once you know they sell, all you have to do is increase the amount of traffic being sent to them.
	- For something like a freelance or consulting service — you can decrease the amount of time you spend on client work as you build leverage.
- "No-code tools" is just a fancy way of saying software that does the work for you. Like little salesman that are up and running 24/7 without costing you a dime (until you are growing fast enough to invest)
	- Gumroad for hosting eBooks, courses, and memberships
	- Calendly for creating a call calendar and booking link
	- Carrd for building fast landing pages to sell your offers better
	- Revue or Convertkit for building an email list
	- Website builders for building a personal site
	- Social media platforms to build an audience (a traffic source like Facebook ads but at zero cost if you know how to use the platform).
- A BIG part of building an audience is educating your audience to get to the point that you are at. That's what they want. They want to become a higher value individual using the methods that got you to that point. **It's about teaching people 1-2 steps behind you because you know exactly how to navigate whatever roadblock someone is facing.**
- Creating high-performing content is about teaching people about it, that simple
- Always tag your sources and here's why: 
	- Citing your sources makes your argument more credible (authority).
	- The podcaster may like, comment, or retweet — meaning you may gain followers from their big audience.
	- The podcaster will remember you, especially if the content was good, meaning you may work with them in the future.
> [!tip] From Zero To Infinity
> You can start from zero.
> 
> You can scale to infinity.
> 
> Do not let any thought that tells you otherwise live in your psyche. Better yet, if you have that thought, write about it online to understand it deeper.
### The Age Of Information
- **One big limiting belief that many have is that they think information is not inherently valuable.** This shouldn't have to be said — but **all we do as human beings is process information**. That is literally it.
- **We go about life, process the information from our experiences, and it either contributes to a better or worse life**. That's why we spend more time than we should soaking in educational, inspirational, and entertaining content on social media and TV.
- Information is everything. It is the foundation of all communication and connection. This is no different online.
> [!tip] Make It A Habit
> Be intentional and conscious of all information you are exposed to. Think critically about how that information can be applied to everyday life.
> 
> An entire brand can be built from this alone.
### The Shift From Corporation To Community
- People are losing trust in the "system."
	- Formal education is overpriced.
	- People are craving human connection and intimacy.
	- Everyone is getting tired of centralization in every industry.
- "You can learn more practical information by watching 20 hours of design-related YouTube videos than with a 4 year design degree."
- **The job is to educate, entertain, and inspire my following.** However, I am not creating followers, I am creating new leaders that can evolve as I do. That is one thing you will learn — **individuals evolve**.
> [!tip] Take Responsibility
> Focus your attention on helping yourself and your community.
> 
> Pay no mind to those that don't vibe with your message.
> 
> Pay all mind to those that you can impact the most — encourage them to spread the message — and start to leave your mark on the world.
## The Creator Mindset
**It’s all in your head.**
- You are a creator and **with that stems a lot of potential problems**: Personal responsibility, self-management, self-reflection, and the ability to execute on your ideas are all necessities in this line of business.
- Personal growth = business growth = personal growth. You are responsible to create your own solutions.
	- You are your own boss
	- You are your own project manager
	- You are your own content marketer
	- You are your own sales team
	- You are everything
### Embrace The Unpredictability
- All of this is unpredictable and you are going to feel lost, a lot.
- You are blessed with the opportunity to chart unknown territory and make new discoveries. True content creation and solopreneurship is NOT taught in schools. Nor should it be. It is very new territory. There are no formal college courses on it. There can be no courses on it. Professors aren't content creators. The landscape is changing every single day.
- The only way you make life-changing discoveries is to do just that — **get lost in the unknown, adopt the mindset of an explorer, and forge your own path to success.** The best thing you can do during these times is:
	- Brain dump journal about what you are struggling with.
	- Turn what you wrote into content (telling yourself what to do).
	- Allow that process to help you discover the problem.
- Do not keep things in your head. Writing is what fills the gaps in your thoughts.
- By documenting your life, thought processes, and experiences online — not only do you learn more about yourself, but you attract others that are experiencing something similar in their life.
- This is only possible if you stay consistent for more than 6 months and open your mind to learning from your failures. _Get used to it. Let go of the need to be perfect. Have faith in the process._
- You will never ever feel like you know exactly what you are doing. **Just create.**
- **Stop listening to people** that tell you what your content, brand, or product are "supposed" to look like. **Put trust in my methods, the principles I teach you, and use them to create your own way of doing things.** That is how you truly succeed in this game.

> *As to methods there may be a million and then some, but principles are few. The man who grasps principles can successfully select his own methods. The man who tries methods, ignoring principles, is sure to have trouble.* **— [[Ralph Waldo Emerson]]**
### Stop Thinking About Saturation And Finding Your Niche
- We ALL follow people based on our unique interests. This alone should prove to you that **saturation does not exist** for personal brands.
- If you can lean into your genuine curiosities, develop your expertise in an area that makes money, and focus on producing high-quality content, products, and services — you win.**This is both the hardest and easiest part.**
- We have to win the battle against ourselves. Against our mind, that is.
- When you find yourself narrowly focused, stressed, and anxious about your progress — zoom out. It's actually the 1, 2, 3, and 4+ year culmination of your content is what makes you irreplaceable.
- Once you have tested, validated ideas that you enjoy talking about — you can grow on other platforms with ease. Growing on Twitter gives you a personal database of what works.
> [!tip] Prioritize Clarity
> Clarity, centropy, and ordered consciousness are your best friend (in life and business). Overthinking, psychic entropy, and chaos are your worst enemy.
> 
> Make it a habit to pause, write out all of your thoughts, and organize them. **Make your mental processes _physical_.**
### The Opportunity Has Never Been Higher
- People can consume short-form tweets, TikToks, reels, and others _faster._
	- Meaning they can be exposed to more creators.
	- Meaning they can follow, and remember more creators.
	- Meaning there will be a lot of terrible content.
	- Meaning if you have a deeper understanding of content and offer creation, you will stand out and make 10x more than the other creators.
> [!tip] Join The 1%
> There **would not** be saturation if there were 50% creators and 50% consumers (creators are STILL consumers).
> 
> But, only 1% are creators.
> 
> And if history repeats itself, that number will stay FAR below 50%.
> 
> The opportunity is that high. You only realize this once you start.
> 
> Those that value consistency will win.
## Skills, Expertise, & Curiosities
**Necessary skills to learn.**
- The effectiveness of your brand, content, and offers are a combination of 3 things:
	- Your skills
	- Your expertise
	- Your curiosities
- Your skill level determines the quality of the value you deliver, your curiosities give you a unique perspective on certain topics, and your expertise allows you to monetize the attention you are grabbing.
- As you go through this course, I would highly recommend _starting_ to read up on the basics, principles, and fundamentals of certain skills.
- Rather than endlessly learning and not knowing how to apply your skills — you can start applying what you learn immediately through your content, free products, and brand.
### Skills That Will Determine Your Success
- Bbuilding a full-fledged personal brand or creator business requires you to learn all of the skills that are necessary for success online.
- Pursuing an intrinsic hierarchy of goals is a big key to happiness. It is how you reap the benefits of the good dopamine that comes from survival mechanisms in your brain. Like working on a hobby project that you deeply care about as opposed to a client project that you grow tired of.

> The mark of a person who is in control of consciousness is the ability to focus attention at will, to be oblivious to distractions, to concentrate for as long as it takes to achieve a goal, and not longer. And the person who can do this usually enjoys the normal course of everyday life. **— [[Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi]]**

- **Here are the skills that will boost the impact and income from your online endeavors:**
	- Copywriting (persuasive writing)
	- Email marketing (for trust-building and sales)
	- Sales (for closing deals and networking properly)
	- Web design (for landing pages and a personal website)
	- Social media growth (for sending traffic and audience building)
	- Graphic design (for visuals and brand assets)
	- Marketing & advertising (for getting people to act)​​​​​​​
- You learn these skills best by learning the principles, starting a real world project (a personal brand), and refining your skills with time and experience. These can all be freelanced or consulted with once you get the hand of them (and if you want to go that route).
- The more you practice these and get results for yourself — the more you understand the nuance of how these skills interact with a specific business. That is how you develop your own unique system and increase your prices IF you want to freelance or consult with these down the road.
- **ALL of these skills rely on a set of meta-skills:**
	- Grabbing and holding attention
	- Storytelling & persuasion
	- Psychology & human behavior
	- Self-awareness and observation
	- Philosophy and spirituality
- You need to **understand how humans make sense of and interpret what they see**. You need to understand different perspectives and viewpoints so you can navigate topics with expertise.
- You need to structure your message (throughout your entire brand, content, and funnel) in a way that leads readers toward a beneficial desired outcome. **None of this will work if you create what you _think_ will help others VS what is actually going to help others**.
> [!tip] Specific Knowledge
> You don't _have_ to do all of these things yourself. You can outsource them.
> 
> But, the process of "figuring it out" is how you acquire specific knowledge. That is how you make new discoveries and help others navigate the path effectively.
### How Your Curiosities Play A Role
- To know what to talk about, you just need to zoom out and think of your content as a seed that will forever grow and expand overtime.
- Your content doesn't just disappear after you write it. You refine your ideas, post them again, and build a library that displays your authority, interests, and personality.
- You incorporate your curiosities by being observant and using them to bring a new perspective to a problem that people face. Your curiosities intersect with your interests, skills, and expertise — **if and only if you are trying to find a way to connect them.**
- **Here is a general way to incorporate your curiosities into your brand:**
	- Write out 2-3 of your interests (the things you LOVE talking about)
	- Write out 2-3 options for eventual monetization (skills or interests like health or performance coaching)
	- Think big and small — write out broader interests and skills, then write out niche interests and skill relating to the 2-3 points you wrote out already. This starts to create a web of content ideas and curiosities to pursue
	- Keep an eye out for books, content, podcasts, and life experiences that check one of those boxes
	- Make a note of it and create some form of content around it

> [!tip] You Are Building A Personal Brand
> Niche brands have their place, but this is for people that want to harness the internet to do what they love (and pursue their life's work).
> 
> It is difficult to put YOU in a box — if not impossible. You are ALLOWED to try different things and pivot whenever you want. You are a human that evolves with time.
> 
> Why would that be any different in a digital reality?
> 
> With practice and busting through limiting beliefs, this will become a reality.
### Solving Your Own Problems And Selling The Solution
- If you don't yet have a solidified offer to sell — or a skill that you are hell-bent on monetizing **— there is another route you can go. This route is an all-in-one "one-person" business model approach.**
- The "one-person" approach is that you are leveraging your ability to solve your own problems, document the process via content, and create a product that you can sell to your former self.
	- Personal growth
	- Social media growth
	- Authority building
	- Market research
	- Marketing
	- Offer creation
- If you attract people with similar interests as you, educate them, and give them a process that shaves 2-3 years off of their learning time — they will pay you. **For example:** I have been passionate about health for the entirety of my adult life.
- **Note to Self:** Your thing would be personal development and or through healing, this is all you have been doing. Finding yourself. Figure out how to make use of this in the business.
- **Your audience will like you for you.** Everyone has burning biological problems in the [[eternal markets]]. You can create a product on anything you feel like **IF** you can position it correctly within those markets.
- **Your personal brand sets you apart** and allows you to sell across markets and very different products is because you are the one who made them aware of their problem and educated them on how to overcome it through my content
> [!tip] The Best Products
> 
> The best products solve a problem that impacts a specific person's direct experience in a positive way.
> 
> By solving your own problems, you do this automatically (and in a unique way).
> 
> This makes it seamless to target a problem in the eternal markets and position it towards a beginner market. Nearly guaranteed sales if you understand the rest of The One Person Business on an experiential level.
## The Eternal & Evergreen Markets
**As close as you can get to guaranteed money.**
- Getting over the pain of your ego will be the first bit of pain to experience.
- _Nobody cares about your skills, interests, what you can build, or what you can help with._ **People are selfish.** They only care about what those skills, interests, and help _can do for them._ Specifically, what it can do to **impact their direct human experience and quality of life.**
### The Eternal Markets
- Health. Wealth. Relationships. Under one umbrella, the main eternal market is Happiness — in more sustainable terms: improving someone's quality of life.
- Stop thinking about your skills and interests. Start thinking about how your skills and interests help solve problems in the eternal markets. How can your skill or interest help someone, the **real utility behind your ideas**:
	- Make more money
	- Free up more time
	- Increase their life enjoyment
	- End unconscious pains
	- Boost their self-esteem
- Leaders are those that help others self-actualize. Solving problems relating to basic human needs and helping them self-actualize is the **principle**in this case.
- Your **method** for solving a problem within one or multiple of those verticals is how you win. **But know that people don't care about the method.** They will use your method IF you can provide a compelling argument for it.
- Your sole purpose in this work (your work) is to present a persuasive argument as to why your method is best for that person.
> [!tip] Focus On Improvement
> Improvement stems from awareness. People cannot improve what they are not aware of.
> 
> Your job is to spread seeds of awareness and funnel people into tools that will help them improve that area of their life.

### Maslow's Hierarchy Of Needs
![[maslow motivation model.png]]
- Your content should be positioned in a way that targets a specific **pain** or **benefit** that lies within Maslow's Hierarchy Of Needs. Pains and benefits. Pains and benefits. **PAINS. AND.** FKING. **BENEFITS.** This is **the foundation of persuasion and sparking behavior change**. Do not write a single piece of content, create a product, or pitch a service without having these in mind. This applies to every single touchpoint of your brand.
	- Your social media profile
	- Your free lead magnet
	- Your email opt-in copywriting
	- Your emails themselves
	- Your landing pages and sales pages
	- Your entire website
	- The teachings in your products
	- Your content, replies, and anything you post online
- Behavior change is how you get other's to improve their lives. In turn, they will attribute their success to you. Win-win.
![[needs intensity vs personal development graph.png]]
- **Keep in mind:**
	- You have to experience these things before you can teach them to someone that is one step behind you.
	- If you want to make it in business (and the world) you have to pursue continuous personal development — especially in the areas of your interests and expertise.
	- Treat this as a seed and allow it to be planted in your head.​​​​​​​
> [!tip] Be Mindful
> Consider the content or products you have already created (or other's content or products that readers have been exposed to).
> 
> What stage are they at? What are they aware of? How can you position your message to impact that specific person in their journey?
### The Beginner Market & Mindset
- One of the biggest mistakes I see creators, solopreneurs, and other online business owners make **– again, pertaining to ego** (**Side note:** notice how I am introducing this topic with a pain — because it makes you interested and keeps you reading.): 
- **They refuse to adopt a beginner's mindset.** They subconsciously see themselves as "too smart" for posting beginner-level content.
- **Newsflash: 90+% of the market are beginners.** ESPECIALLY those that are on short form, top-of-funnel platforms which are easiest to grow on like:
	- Twitter
	- TikTok
	- Facebook
	- Instagram
	- LinkedIn (in some regards)
- If you can teach former you (**that was a beginner**) how to get to where you are now in a streamlined way, you win. That is more difficult than it sounds (hence this course), but that is the key to success in a nutshell. **This is why [beginner products sell the best.](https://mentalmonetization.com/)**
- **Remember**: saturation doesn't exist when you are selling from a unique perspective to your Niche Of One audience. People buy from you because it's you, not a huge centralized platform that they aren't even aware of.)
- **Here is a general, foolproof process for making a solid income:**
	- Post beginner and intermediate level content from your unique perspective (based on research and experience)
	- Educate people and **go more in-depth** with longer-form emails, articles, and a lead magnet to raise them up Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs (**THIS is where you can show how smart you are and build a deeper connection without having to worry about the algorithm**).
	- Sell a beginner level product to filter out buyers from free-loaders
	- Again, **you are educating them to the point of being a fit for your other products or services** (creating your own customers in a sense).
	- Upsell another product, membership, or freelance / consulting service to those that purchased your product.
- It is not optimal to build everything in the order layed out above and that's for you to discover. But **when in doubt –– go beginner level**.

> [!tip] You Probably Have Enough Experience
> 
> Don't sell yourself short. If you are taking this course, I'm sure you've improved certain areas of your life.
> 
> Reflect on those times — did you know _anything_ similar to what you know now?
> 
> Would your seemingly "basic" advice help your former self? Yes? Then it will help others. Zoom out.
## Products & Services
**How to actually make money.** 
- If you are an absolute beginner — I want to **get this out of your head now**: Do not rely on any platform for the foundation of your income.
	- YouTube adsense
	- Twitter "super follows"
	- Instagram reels
	- Patreon or other similar platforms are okay — but you will see the best results (in business AND personal life) if you provide a product or service.
- Creating **your own** product or service is the only way you become in full control of how much money you make. That is — packaging up the information in your head in a simple, impactful, and understandable way.
	- This will require you to grow as a person.
	- This will require you to develop your skill set.
	- This will require you to bust through levels of personal development that will cause massive discomfort.
- The knowledge that you packaging and ship is **what you become known for.** 
### Types Of Products & Services
- There are 3 types of products and services. This is similar to the [[offer shell]] the [[JK Molina]] uses.
	- Done for you
	- Done with you
	- Do it yourself
- Reason to focus on digital products and sometimes services depending on the person: 
	- They are the most accessible, cost nearly $0 to create, and can be sold infinitely once they are built.
	- They allow you to work your way up the experience ladder. The only thing stopping you from charging $100+ for a consulting call is your mind (unless you are an ABSOLUTE beginner).
	- They allow you to get results and establish authority fast. You can use those results for anything else you create.
	- You can change and improve them at any time to make more money.
	- If they are a good product or service, you can expand your offering into physical products, software as a service, or anything else you want to create.
- A digital product or service stack allows you to **build authority in your space, create a full-time income for yourself quick, and open up new opportunities for your business**.

> [!tip] You Are In Control
> 
> Start a project right now. Like RIGHT now. Write it down.
> 
> The sooner you do this, the sooner you can identify unconscious blindspots and create a better product or service.
> 
> These are not physical products. You can change and improve them at anytime.

### **The Evolution Of Your Offer Stack**
When you are just starting out, it doesn't make sense to create a full-blown digital product. However, this is heavily dependent on your personal goals and what you talk about. In _most_ cases, this is the smartest progression when starting from zero:
#### Step 1 – Create a Lead Magnet
A lead magnet is **a way of establishing authority fast**. A lead magnet is **a free product that people receive in exchange for their email**. This allows you to:
- Show your expertise
- Build a deeper connection
- Give immense value that wouldn't do well on social media (because of algorithms)
- Gives you content ideas to start establishing authority in your emails, articles, and short-form posts
- Make people aware of their problems and educate them to the point of solving them
- Allow you to talk about your interests more — because the lead magnet is there for those that want help on what you have expertise in
- Form the foundation and outline of your first [[Minimum Viable Offer]] for **step 2 - building a service business**.​​​​​​​

Don't overthink this yet. Anyone can create a 2-3 page lead magnet based around one problem in the area you want to become an expert in. Little experience required.
#### Step 2 – Start a Service Business
- Freelancing or consulting (I prefer consulting) with your skill or expertise of choice. At the start, you will help people for free, so there isn't any pressure to deliver insane results.
- Helping people for free in the DMs or on a call will lead to deeper connections, potential paid work, and it will shine a light on what you _don't_ know — so you can learn about it and improve your skill set. **Then you can start charging.**
- The two types of services you can offer:
	- A pack of 4 one-hour-long calls for $500 to help someone in your area of expertise.
	- In the case of freelancing, this can be a simple landing page, email, content writing, or anything else for ~$500.
- As you offer this service for free you will discover:
	- What gets results
	- What skills you have to learn to improve your offer
	- What problem people are really trying to solve (that you only find by talking to these people and immersing yourself in an online environment that they hang out in)
	- Then you can start to **create your own unique system**, promise better results, and increase your prices accordingly.
- You don't need a large following to do this. **All you need is perceived authority** (brand and content) and the ability to send a DM like a normal person — which we go over in [[Non-Needy Networking]].
#### Step 3 – Turn Your System Into A Product
Once you have proven results and a replicable process / system that you've tested on your clients — you can turn it into a product.

**Why do this after you've gone the service business route?** Because (hopefully) you've built an audience along the way AND you have testimonials from the start. It's guaranteed to sell and free up time for you.
- _**Buyers buy again**_ — meaning most of your clients at this point will come from those that purchased your product (so you don't have to spend time DMing people anymore). This is just like the [[customer/client inertia]] that [[JK Molina]] talks about.
- Worst case scenario, your product doesn't sell. You can just iterate and try again! Remember you are in full control, and this knowledge should be liberating for you –– **nothing is permanent in this game**.
- The one thing that will screw you up from the beginning is the NEED to make money fast. **If this is the case for you, get a job.**
#### Step 4 –– Expand Your Offering With Complimentary Products
- At this point, you can do really anything you want. Anything is possible.
- Everyone has the same problems within the eternal markets. Every problem has a different method of being solved that is unique to you (how you solve it).
	- If you want to pivot and try something completely new, you can.
	- If you want to turn your product or service into a software, you can.
	- If you want to take on public speaking gigs relating to your expertise, you can.
	- If you want to build a membership product or community for recurring income, you can.
> [!tip] Focus On Results
> If I could give you one piece of advice:
> 
> **Just start helping people.**
> 
> DM someone that you want to meet. Get to know them. Ask them what they are working on. See if your skills can help with that. Offer to help them for free and give them tips.
> 
> At minimum, you have a connection that respects you. At maximum, you get results and potential work from them OR referrals.
### An Example To Show You What's Possible
Let's start with a small, overly attainable goal for beginners: $50,000 a year (on the low end, **I would say $200,000 but that is hard to get people to believe when they don't have prior awareness or a bad relationship with money).**

#### There 3 options to hit 50'000/200'000 CHF in a year.
##### Option No.1 –– Land 4 clients per month at 1'000/4'000 CHF
- This can be a single skill-based freelance service OR a pack of 4 calls consulting service. Let's say you do that for 3 months at the beginning, get results, and increase your prices - then you would only have to land 2 clients per month at $2000. 
- You can start landing clients with a **proper DM method** when you have a small following. When done right, it would take 5-10 DMs to do this correctly.
- You can also write a targeted thread, get eyes on it through DMs or paid shares, and land clients that way.
- As you continue building your audience, you can stop spending so much time on sending DMs.
- As you increase prices, you can charge $2500-$5000 for your services and make 6 figures from client work alone.
##### Option No.2 –– Sell 43/48 digital products at 99/350 CHF for 50'000/200'00 CHF a year
Again, there are many ways to do this at many different price points. **But once you have built an audience and content ecosystem that makes sales for you, this is more than possible.**

When I had 500-3000 followers, I was making around $3,500 from digital products alone because I knew **how to leverage other's audiences** (next module on Distribution Networks).
##### Option No.3 –– Do Both
If you only stick to selling one type of offer over the other, you are shooting yourself in the foot.

The majority of your high-ticket clients will have bought your digital products beforehand.

Digital products are also a way of "creating your own clients," because you are educating them to the point of becoming a client.

Now you can focus on selling the digital product, have processes in place to have them sign on with you, and have a diversified source of income that you can scale as high as you want.
## Distribution Networks
**Build distribution, then build anything you want.**
_How do you make money online?_

It's simple, and the same as any other type of **transaction** in life (whether it be social, financial, etc).

**Remember**: a transaction of any kind must be beneficial to _all_ parties involved. Not just the buyer and seller — also the provider, employees, and everything else involved. Ethics.
### The two things required to make money:
1. **An Offer ––** the **specific desired outcome that you are promising** they will get when they purchase and use it. You are **selling a desired _benefit_ that helps resolve their _pain**._ Humans are emotional beings, not logical. We are constantly looking for minor or major ways to change the quality of our lives.
2. **Interested Traffic ––** Traffic is people. When you build an audience and plug your product, you are sending traffic to it. **That is the only way you make sales**. You have to be intentional about where you are placing the offer, how it is perceived to that person, and place a heavy focus on how it impacts their life.

The 2 problems you will always need to solve for when making money.
1. Your offer sucks (**you don't have enough perceived value to them**).
2. Your traffic sucks (**you aren't putting yourself in an environment where potential dates are**).

**What if the traffic isn't interested?** It is your job to educate them to the point of making them aware. If you are selling a high level service but you are attracting beginners with your content — **do you have free or paid resources (or content) in place to get them to the point of buying your high level service?** This is what a 'funnel' is in a nutshell. You take people from _unaware to aware_ and _beginner level to your level_.
### Your Personal Distribution Network
Build a distribution network, that have traffic that you can send at will. 
#### Take this as an example:
I get 5-10 million impressions per month on Twitter _alone_. Close to triple that when you account for other platforms. (This would normally cost anywhere from $35,000 - $70,000 with paid ads.)

**If you can get 10 people to buy a $27 product per day, you make 6 figures a year.**
- That means you need to get **400 of those 5-10 million people** a day to click on your page.
- If you have a ***low* 2.5% conversion rate**... you make 6 figures.
And that's on a $27 product... imagine if you charge more, promote more, and have other offers in place to extend [[lifetime value]].
#### How do you build a network of potential traffic sources that you can send to your products nearly on demand?
##### No.1 –– Your Audience
Create content that pulls in a following. If you focus on awareness and education, you create interested traffic.

Start by dominating one platform — then use your validated content, social proof, and network to grow rapidly on other platforms (and funnel your audience there).
##### No.2 –– Your Email List
You can get banned from platforms at any time for making a stupid mistake.

You cannot, however, have the CSV file of emails taken from you. They are yours. If you get 'banned', which is unlikely, you just transfer them to another email provider.

If you have limiting beliefs about email marketing and its ability to make sales — eradicate them from your psyche now. Whatever they are, they are wrong. Don't assume what you haven't experienced.
##### No.3 –– Your Network
Make friends online along your journey through social media, be social, build connections. 

Friends are always happy to help support — as you should be happy to support them — because we understand that **cooperation is infinitely better than competition. _Buyers buy again**._

If we all get 5-10 million impressions per month and one of us does a promotion for our offer...That's 5-10+ friends of mine sending _all of our traffic to one offer._

This stresses the importance of learning how to network, socialize, and make friends online (like you would in real life).​​​​​​​
##### No.4 –– A Community
If you have the bandwidth to start a free or paid community, this is another traffic source for you to promote to.

Think of a platform like Discord, Circle, Telegram, or somewhere else to build authority away from the algorithm.

**All of these form your [[Personal Distribution Network]].**

As this grows, you gain leverage. You can begin to free up time and focus on bigger levers.

This also brings up the concept of [[social capital]]. I have traded retweets for Instagram shares, LinkedIn comments, money, and really anything else.

This can also lead to brand deals, public speaking gigs, job opportunities, and people spreading your message throughout their daily life.

**_Money isn't the only currency when you have leverage, distribution, and social capital._**
### How To Make Money When You Don't Have Distribution
When you don't have an audience or other distribution built, you have to rely on outreach, referrals, and connections. Meaning, you have to form the habit of DMing and meeting people that you can offer your value to.

**You may not believe this, but higher ticket offers are easier to sell than lower ticket offers.**
- You don't need an audience
- You can make your offer hyper specific
- You can talk people through the awareness and sales process
- You can walk through a "sales page" on a call with them

If you create a **minimum viable consulting offer** (like a pack of 4 calls for $500-$1000), you can start earning immediately. This is why I recommend starting with a service business, making some money, getting results, and packaging up that system into a product.

**Reach out to people that have:**
- Less followers than you
- Similar followers as you
- More followers than you
- People that you would die to work with (the ones whose business you are passionate about, that excitement will show in your outreach message).

**_Want to start on the right foot?_** Give them a compliment on a piece of content that didn't go viral. A piece of content that you know is meaningful to them, that you vibe with, and that will pique their interest.

People like being praised for their work — especially the work that not many people noticed. Then, ask them what they do and what they are working on.

If they mention something you can help with, **offer help**.

> Get in the habit of messaging 5 people a day. It can be anyone. The goal is to get used to meeting new people.

## Awareness & Attention
**How to capture, hold, and leverage attention.**

**Remember this:** humans are emotional, not logical beings.
We are constantly looking to resolve our conscious pains, become aware of our unconscious pains, and implement solutions that benefit our quality of life.
### The Levels Of Awareness
This is the 1 concept that will save you a lot of pain on your creator journey:
1. **Unaware:** unaware of the problem
2. **Problem Aware:** aware that they have a problem but not sure what is causing it or how to solve it
3. **Solution Aware:** aware that a solution exists, but are unaware of your solution (free or paid resources)
4. **Product Aware:** aware of your free or paid solution, but either haven't implemented it or are hesitant on purchasing
5. **Most Aware:** aware of your solution and are ready to act on it — all they need is a little push (with persuasion and influence)

Your top-of-funnel content (social media platforms) should target all of the above, with levels 1-3 as the priority.

Your bottom-of-funnel content (emails, lead magnets, and products) should also target all of the above, with levels 3-5 as the priority.
### Attention Is The New Currency
Almost every touchpoint of your brand, content, and products involve a transaction of some form.The first step towards any transaction of value is capturing attention.

**Some transactions include:**
- Free content in exchange for engagement and shares
- Free products in exchange for their email
- Deeper, more valuable content in exchange for a click
- Going from a DM to a call
- Going from a call to a sale

Your ability to create that transaction is based on capturing, holding, and converting attention. This is why content writers always stress nailing the hook or headline of a post.

**The tried and true ways of capturing attention include:**
- Calling out who you are talking to (like what someone does for work)
- Targeting a pain point that someone is experiencing
- Opening a curiosity loop (by asking a question or implying a puzzle with a missing piece)
- Using statistics, numbers, and other pattern interrupts that pull readers out of their mindless scrolling

If somebody doesn't read the hook or headline and feel compelled to dive deeper based on their level of awareness — they aren't going to read the rest of your content (or go through the rest of your course).

There are more tips and tricks for capturing attention, but those are dependent on _what_ you are trying to capture attention with.
- **Short-form content** (like tweets and IG posts) doesn't allow much space for depth — so we need to be tactical with how we write
- **Medium-form content** (like LinkedIn posts, carousels, and threads) can have a proper hook, body, and conclusion rapidly — it's "easier" to keep the reader engaged with how they are structured.
- **Long-form content** (like emails and articles) allow for a lot of creativity, storytelling, and general value — so we need to understand that.
#### Questions to Answer
- Are you conscious of who you are talking to at every touchpoint in your brand?
- Your social media bio? Your pinned tweet? Highlighted posts? Lead magnet opt in page? Email list opt in? Landing page writing? Podcasts, videos, articles? Specific tweets? Post-buyer emails? When someone DMs you? When you DM someone else?
- What part of the journey are your readers on and what journey are you going to take them on when you capture their attention?
- How can you craft a message that is _specific_ to them and where they are at?

> This is a well-talked about subject. You can find many different resources on persuasive communication, capturing attention, and how the mind interprets what it reads.

### Foundational Tips For Holding Attention
When it comes to holding attention, you must understand the principles of storytelling and persuasion (they are the same thing). When you are creating online, throw everything you know about communication out the window.

**You are writing to build a connection**. Similar to how you would in real life, but a bit more tactical.

The very first step for impactful communication, specifically writing (as we will be starting with writing), **is readability.** Notice the spacing used on Twitter (x), some articles, and sales pages. This is done to guide the readers attention.
#### Quickly implementable tips for holding attention
Humans are always trying to piece together the puzzle. **They want to know what came before and after a certain point in a story** (the situation that you are referring to in your content). Keep all of this in mind as you are reading content.
- Space out your sentences (press "enter" after 1-3 sentences). This can be longer in blog posts
- Be mindful of how your content looks — does it guide the reader down the page? Does it have rhythm and intention behind how it is written?
- Keep sentences as short and impactful as you can — edit filler words that detract from the message
- If you can't keep them short, use dashes "—" and parenthesis so their attention doesn't get tired, **keep people guessing** (you can see how I do this throughout my writing).
- Use bullet points, lists, and other methods that imply that _something comes next_

> [!tip] Intention
> Do not overthink this, but be mindful of what kind of person you are targeting with your content.
> 
> What are they going through? What did you go through at that timeframe? How did you overcome it? How can you deliver that message in a way that delivers full impact?
## The Greatest Skill
**Persuasion, influence, and storytelling.**

Every. Single. Skill you can learn that will help you succeed in this space is amplified by **persuasion.**
- Persuasion is what separates the accounts that grow from those that don't.
- Persuasion is what separates the accounts that make money from those that don't.
- Persuasion is what separates the accounts that have their value heard from those who don't.

The **deciding factor** of all (ethical) transactions in your social, financial, professional, and personal life depends on your **ability to persuade**. Persuasion, in a nutshell, is **how you convince someone to believe something**.

I like to think of it as _creating an argument_ to **adopt your perspective and see the benefit in viewing things in the way that you do**. It's about pains and benefits and if you **keep these 3 questions** in mind when creating — your engagement, sales, authority, and perceived value will shoot through the roof.
- What are the downsides of viewing things from a certain perspective and the day-to-day pains associated with it?
- What are the upsides of viewing things from a new perspective and the day-to-day benefits associated with it?
- What is the process for getting there and can you make it simple enough to act on immediately?

The more specific, confident, and credible you can be with this argument, the better. **You make an argument credible** by pulling from different sources (perspectives) — these do not have to be scientifically proven. You do this by consuming information that you love reading and writing about.)
### The Building Blocks Of A Persuasive Argument
#### The goal of persuasion is 3 things: 
- **Sparking positive behavior change** — by working people through their levels of awareness and persuading them to fix their problems (advice only works if it is taken). This applies to content, products, and services. Behavior change is what makes people remember you for changing their life.
- **Getting the conversion** — Making the sale, scheduling a date, getting engagement, having your content shared, etc. There has to be an exchange of value here, a transaction.
- **Mutual benefit** — the difference between manipulation and persuasion is the benefit. We want to aim to deliver _more_ value than what we receive.
#### 6 building blocks for crafting a persuasive argument:
##### No.1 –– Reciprocity
Our social evolution makes us feel compelled to return favors, even if it's something like a compliment on someone's work (in exchange for something like a retweet). **When you give value without expectation of repayment, others feel compelled to return the favor.**

This can take form as a free guide, a bonus product for a promotion, sending someone a strategy you learned, or just wishing someone a happy Monday.

**In short, give out value and good things will come to you.**

This can also be used in **negotiation with a [[price anchor]]** — you start high and work low. When you do them the favor of **dropping the price (intelligently)** they feel compelled to meet that favor.
##### No.2 –– Commitment / Consistency
**Humans feel obligated to follow through with their word.** When they say they are going to do something, they begin to justify to themselves why they should do it.

A "commitment" here can be as simple as liking a post, clicking a link, filling out a form, etc. In the creator business, this can be used by easing people into things and getting them to take the lowest friction action first — **that is the commitment**.

After one commitment, they feel compelled to continue on that commitment — **leading to making larger and larger commitments (think of a funnel)**. I beleieve this is the [[customer/client inertia]] that [[JK Molina]] talks about.
###### A sample sequence of commitments from low-friction to high:
- Read the hook of a Twitter thread
- Click the tweet to read the entire thread
- Finish the thread because they've already started reading it
- Retweet the thread based on your call to action at the bottom
- Click the landing page to download your lead magnet
- Read through the lead magnet
- Click the call to action to buy your product
- Go through the product
- Click the call to action to fill out a [[qualifying questionnaire]] (for your service), this is like Daniel Priestly (**did i spell this right?**), i think
- Get on a call to learn more about your service
- Pay the invoice to become a client of yours

**Keep this in mind at all times. It works for everything, for example [[Dan Koe]]'s Instagram:**
- Even in my Instagram carousels. I start with a short and punchy sentence that once they finish, seems like a small commitment has been made.
- Then as they scroll through the carousel, I bring in deeper and deeper topics, eventually leading to a call to action to download something of mine and bring them deeper into my funnel.
##### No.3 –– Social Proof
**People are not confident in their day to day actions**. We are constantly looking to confirm our beliefs, choices, and actions. Because of this, **we look to others beliefs, choices, and actions** to see if something is credible or not.
- Social proof like testimonials, results, and word of mouth marketing is the most powerful persuasion tool in your arsenal. The more authentic and non-planned, the better.
- **A sales page with a few words and tons of social proof will always outperform a sales page with tons of words and low social proof.**
- How often an idea is talked about — If everyone starts talking about how seed oils are bad, many are going to hop on the train without doing any research themselves.

**Other examples of social proof:**
- **The engagement on a post** — When I post a screenshot of a tweet to Instagram with the engagement included, I get more engagement because other people have already liked it and validated the idea. If I retweet a post that has 100 likes, it will do better than if I retweet a post with 2 likes.
- **The amount of followers you have** — at the start, you will grow slower simply because you don't have much social proof. 
- **The amount of customers one has** — I have 13,000+ students inside 2 Hour Writer. It wouldn't have made it that far if it didn't get results.
##### No.4 –– Like
You are more likely to trust and be persuaded by somebody that you like. Your personal brand is meant to guide people's perception of you. 

**Tips on liking:**
- If you are speaking to a specific group of people with similar interests as you, it is likely that they like who you are.
- This alone will have people buying from you as opposed to a huge brand that is selling a similar product.
- We tend to like people that like us.
##### No.5 –– Authority
We tend to trust authoritative figures much quicker than less authoritative people. Always build elements of authority into all of your content, just be tactful, creative, and most importantly be on your self-development (this is key).

**Authority is determined by:**
- Level of expertise
- Accomplishments in a specific area
- Well known labels, symbols, or achievements (like the Nobel Prize, NYT Best Seller, or just something like a police uniform)
- Amount of social proof
- Celebrity or micro-celebrity status
- Speaking with confidence and using absolutes (wisely)
##### No.6 –– Reciprocity
In other words, [[FOMO]].

**Example of [[FOMO]]:**
- When Bitcoin skyrockets, people buy more out of emotion.
- When Bitcoin drops hard, people sell more out of emotion.
- One reason why cohorts like this sell very well is because there is a deadline for enrollment. The last day is always the day you make more sales.
- The same goes for special product launches, limited quantities available, deadlines on promotional offers, and the rest.

Scarcity is a gauge for how valuable something is — simple [[supply and demand]]. This can be abused very easily — so **ease into your use of scarcity and do your best to be ethical** about it. Scarcity can be worked into your content or products. 
##### In conclusion of the 6
All of those 6 building blocks solve [[fixed action patterns]] in one's brain. In essence, by including more of these to form a persuasive argument, you are making it seamless for people to get what they want out of your brand, content, and products.

> [!tip] Be Mindful
> Whenever you are writing or speaking, put effort into constructing a persuasive argument for the sake of a positive beneficial outcome.
> 
> This will hurt your brain at first. Give it time and practice — it will become second nature.
### The Conversion Process
The purpose of all of these (persuasion, storytelling, and sales) is to get people to act — **or to convert** — at whatever part of the funnel they are in (again, keep levels of awareness in mind here).
### 6 practical building blocks for persuasion
You can treat these as an extra 6 practical building blocks for persuasion if you would like. You can piece them together for impactful short or long-form content. These can be used individually for short form content, or in step-by-step succession for longer form content.
#### The Big Problem
- Every story, sales page, and even tweet has a problem that is explicitly stated or implied by describing a part of the situation.
- The big problem can branch into smaller problems that people experience because of that problem.
- By painting a picture of the problem that an individual is facing, you begin to make them aware of it and seek a solution.
- This usually occurs in the introduction or "lead" of a long-form piece of content.
#### Agitate & Dig Deeper
**On a sales call, your job is to be a doctor.** You ask questions to dig deeper and understand what the pain is that is actually causing the problem.

In content, you don't have to ask questions, but you can **guide people deeper into how the big problem is impacting their experience** (raising their awareness even more).
#### Relatability
**Like social proof**, people want their beliefs, choices, and actions to be confirmed. See "[[confirmation bias]]" in psychology. This is similar to the [[Obvious Problem Obvious Solution]] or [[Obvious Problem Non-Obvious Solution]], I think from (it may only apply to one) *[[Snow Leopard by Category Pirates]]*.

If you can **relate to the problems people are experiencing** with personal or client stories, you **show them that change is possible** — and that they aren't in the wrong.

This is also why memes do so well. They **help people feel like they aren't alone**.
#### No.4 — Benefits
Humans love transformations (**just look at physique transformations on YouTube**). Transformations are inspirational — but they don't have to be literal transformations.

The **_thought_ of an implied transformation** by showing the benefits to overcoming certain problems is a transformation in itself. If **readers' [[awareness levels]] are high enough**, that is when they will act on on the step-by-step solution you give them.

When you are talking about a product, **the usual option is to flex the "features" of that product rather than the benefits of those features**. Both are necessary, but the **benefits are what sell**.

**A benefit is how their life is affected on a direct and _specific_ level. Specificity is key here.** Here’s an example: 
- **Feature**: 1 gigabyte of storage.
- **Benefit**: Never run out of space for storing memories of your newborn son.
The latter is **targeted at a _specific type of person_** that would use the 1 gigabyte of storage in a _specific way._

**Question to ask yourself when writing on benefits:**
Can you guess what the type of person is and how we are painting a picture of how they would use that feature? (You don't have to be explicit. Often times it is better to be implicit. Let the reader fill in the blanks with their imagination.)

The best way to have your benefits register, is to use rich language. Keep you eyes open for content and landing pages that do this well. 
#### The Perfect Solution
As we are crafting this argument with pains, agitation, relatability, and benefits — we are **raising peoples awareness to the point of becoming aware of a solution**.

The solution you offer needs to be **_perceived_ as the perfect solution** based on the argument you've constructed (the reality you've created through communication and framing of the argument).
- Your job is to position a solution according to the problem and person you are speaking to.
- Your job is to **cause that raise in dopamine that sparks the "aha!" moment.** The breakthrough. The "this may finally be the solution to my problem."
- _Then, you deliver as much value as you possibly can to fulfill that promise._

Keep in mind that this argument is constructed in different ways across your entire brand. **That is where the fun and creativity come into play**.
#### Clarity On Next Steps
"How to" guides always do well for one reason **— it gives people the one thing they crave (and often lack) — _clarity._**

The **best call to actions at the end of a post give step by step**, low-friction ways of guiding the reader to take the next action (**or make the next commitment**).

The **more specific you can get with this, the better.** People often need step-by-step instruction on what to do next.

**An example in action:**
- **In Twitter threads** — "Go to the first tweet that is linked here, press the retweet button, come back, and read the next tweet."
- **In Call To Actions** — "Buy Now" - "Download the free guide"
- **In How To Guides** — Giving clear and actionable steps to achieving a desired outcome

> [!tip] Play The Game
> 
> Play the game of influence until you become so good that you can be artful with your craft and "draw outside of the lines."
> 
> Train your mind to think in terms of problems and benefits that occur in any given situation. This is how you turn topics, life experiences, and random thoughts into compelling content.
## The Keys To Success
**Understand how to “figure it out”.**
No matter what information you receive you have to develop the skill of "[[figuring it out]]", this is a crucial piece of development. That is how you create the most value. "If I can teach it to you, I can teach it to others."

**Your job is to take everything I say here, _understand it through direct experience_, and _create_ a way of doing things that is unique to you.**
### Learning By Doing, Imitating, & Emulating
- Life becomes more meaningful when you can connect everyday thoughts, experiences, information, and stimuli to a project. In other words, you are [[nerobiologically]] rewarded with dopamine and other chemicals when you apply what you learn.
- A personal brand is a giant project that allows you to test, understand, and practice everything you learn.

Throughout this course, we will be focused on the principles and fundamentals of any given skill. **Your job is to implement _immediately_ by applying that information to your brand.**
- You learn web design by creating websites and landing pages.
- You learn to write persuasively by practicing persuasive writing.
- You learn storytelling by telling stories in your content and products.

> Awareness begets awareness.

You cannot become aware of what you need to learn unless you have applied and understood what you are currently aware of — otherwise it stays in your head and causes random problems that you are unconscious of.
- Research the basics, fundamentals, and principles online (Google, YouTube, books, book summary apps — like Shortform or Blinkist)
- (If necessary) Research the best tool (software, product, etc) to get the job done at your experience level and watch a video on how the basics of that tool
- Find 3-5 "mentors" to pull inspiration from (whether it be design, tone of voice, writing style, problems they use, benefits they use, anything)
- Outline a real-world project by combining everything you found by researching your mentors — this can be "fake" for practice or straight into your brand
- Start the project, become aware of what step you are struggling with, and research how to do that specifically via Google or YouTube
- Complete a first iteration of the project, publish it, see if it gets the results you'd like, and improve it as you learn more about the skill — this is a lifelong process.

An example of this process for **creating a beautiful profile picture or header image** would be:
- Research graphic design or headshot photography principles or basics on YouTube — take notes on the _levers_ you can pull with the least amount of effort to get the best results
- Research a tool to create a profile picture or header image (PhotoShop or Canva) and watch a video on how to navigate it FOR a profile picture or header
- Find 3-5 people on social media whose designs you like, specifically their profile picture or header image
- Try to recreate the best parts of their image with your own
- Watch videos or search for resources to help you navigate roadblocks you encounter (at a basic level, everyone has hit these roadblocks and you CAN find resources online, it may take a bit of digging.

**This is the process for learning anything rapidly.** Visualize the end result, outline the project, and research to solve problems along the way to create your first iteration of a project.

> [!tip] Create Momentum
> You can only create momentum and inspiration by doing.
> 
> Get in the habit of starting projects that you have no idea how to complete and figure out how to complete it.
> 
> **Embrace the struggle**. That's where the most impactful lessons come from.
### Documenting Your Life
When you applied what you've learned in a public setting, you are documenting the phases of your life. 

By putting your creations out into the real world, your next creations will be built on (or iterated from) the previous creation.

Think of your idea generation, content curation and synthesis, life experiences, and creations that stem from those as documentation.
- You are documenting your mind and consciousness when you make sense of ideas
- You are documenting your failures, successes, and solutions to problems in your content
- You are documenting systems for getting results in certain areas of life with your products
- You are helping guide and order the consciousness of others throughout all of this **— especially consulting**
- You are documenting and **creating systems for yourself** "behind the scenes" to produce better work and make more money

**All of these things will hold more value than you could ever imagine in 2-3 years.**
#### Often unseen benefits of this line of work.
- People remember the ideas that you introduced them to and how it changed their life (most won't explicitly tell you this until years later).
- People will get massive results from your product and praise you for your work.
- Your products, content, brand, and life will improve with each and every iteration.

> It is You — but at scale. Connected to the universe that the coders have created.
## Action Steps
**What you should be focusing on.**
### The 80/20 Of Branding, Audience Building, & Content Creation
What your brand and content are a composition of:
- **YOUR vision for your future** — this is your brand mission, what are you leading your followers towards?
- **2-3 broad topics that you love reading and talking about** — you will consume information relating to these for idea generation and **mention them in your bio to show what you talk about**. _These broad topics become niche topics when you break them down into sub-categories and target a specific problem within that category._
- **Your expertise** — what skills do you have (or skills that you are learning) and how are they helping you actualize your vision for the future? How do they resolve the pains of others and help them reach that vision?
- Again, remember levels of awareness, persuasion, the eternal markets, and the evergreen markets. How can you craft a brand message and content relating to all of those?
### The Project Of You
Make it a habit to get inspiration from those you aspire to be like.

How is there bio worded? What awareness level is it targeting? What does their content look like? Why does it make people engage?

**Be hyper-conscious** of yourself when looking at accounts you look to emulate.

At the very beginning, you do not have a following. Your account will not grow from content alone. You need to deconstruct the platform and understand what makes people GROW.

_Here are the levers you should be moving regarding building an audience (these are just a few strategies of many):_
- **Engaging with big accounts** — respond to accounts with a large following 10-20 times per day with _your personal experience relating to the topic they posted about._ **Do not** reply by rewording what they said. **Remember — pains, benefits, and transformations for a specific awareness level** — that is what will make people follow you.
- **Networking with people you want to work with** — send 3-5 DMs per day complimenting someone you want to work with on a recent post of theirs. **Follow up with them in a few days with content that you wrote using theirs as inspiration. DM it to them** and tell them that they inspired what you wrote (many times they will engage with it, boosting the amount of impressions it gets).
- **Writing beginner-level educational content** — we need a balance of growth and authority. **Target a very beginner level (and low level of awareness) problem** and educate people on how to overcome it. List style posts (bullet point steps) work the best in this scenario. Then turn each of the bullet points into their own post.
- **Leveraging traffic through curation** — write a thread or a post and mention large accounts in it (they may engage with it). If you write a thread about fitness and go over a talking point that a large account talks about, recommend people to follow that account.
- **Immerse yourself in a conducive growth environment** — for the next 30 days, follow the people you aspire to be like and comment on their posts. Watch YouTube videos and only expose yourself to an echo chamber of content that you would want to create. Listen to audiobooks and podcasts on the topics you want to talk about. Read 1 book this month on something that you _may_ want to be known for. This alone will fill your mind with ideas on how to grow and write.
- [ ] Add in here the [[$1.80 Strategy]] and [[Down in the DMs]] strategies from [[Garyvee]] and whatever else he's got to use
- [ ] Pull the strategies or rather concepts for 30 for 30 and [[Snow Leopard by Category Pirates]] to your content writing.
- [ ] Read and implement the teaching from [[The Art And Business Of Online Writing by Nicolas Cole]] 

**The question to answer** — how can you get more EYES on your profile? Where are the people that you want to follow you hang out and how can you make yourself well known in that space? **Consistency and repetition is key here.**
### The Highest Leverage Play
The ABSOLUTE most important thing to building an audience is connections.

**Do not work in isolation.** Getting on calls with other people and helping them without expecting a thing in return **is the highest ROI thing you can do in this space**. If you can do the following, you will win. That is a promise.
- DM anyone that catches your eye
- Compliment them on their work
- Ask them what their goals are and what they are working on
- Treat it as a normal conversation, like you were meeting someone at a party or texting a good friend — don't be robotic or needy — play it cool
- Share strategies you have learned and ask if they want to help each other grow
- Engage with accounts with insightful and introspective replies
- Make yourself known by getting your ideas out there
- Let everyone know what you do so they can pass your name along
- Offer whatever value you can to everybody you cross
- [ ] Make a reference sheet from the highest leverage Play for when you message people who's works you are into
- [ ] Create some form of a CRM sheet to track the people you are connecting with
- [ ] Connect yourself with other who are on the path of categories of one creators.

**IF — and only if** — you have all other areas of The One-Person Business locked down. **People won't follow consumer-looking accounts** or those that don't put out value).

**It's time to start taking your work — and yourself — seriously.**
### If You Haven't Already...
#### Step 01 –– Create A Twitter & Newsletter Platform
If you already have a Twitter account and an email marketing software (for long form posts that ALL of our content will stem from — and builds a deeper connection that Twitter) then disregard this part. If not:

Create a Twitter account or use your current one — do not start over from scratch, you need all of the initial followers (social proof) you can get. **Clean up your profile picture, bio, and who you are following.**

Create a [Beehiiv](https://www.beehiiv.com/) account and walk through all of the settings — Do not worry about subscriber count or anything really. Just set it up and make sure you are ready to create your first long-form article.

Why Beehiiv? It allows you to link people to previous newsletters you have created. **This is crucial for the content ecosystem we will build out in [2 Hour Writer](https://2hourwriter.com/).**

ConvertKit is another worthy option if you want to write email sequences, but if you are an absolute beginner, Beehiiv works.  

Down the road, you can transfer your emails to another platform, build a personal site for yourself, and upload previous newsletters to the blog.

**If you are on a different social media platform, still, start a Twitter account. That is such low hanging fruit.** You don't need visuals. You just need to write. You can transfer any short-form content you've already written over to it.
- [ ] Clean up your social media accounts
- [ ] Pull inspiration from the content you have made on TikTok that popped off including the lives
- [ ] Decide on using ConvertKit or Beehiiv as you have both
#### Step 02 –– Make Your First Post
Write your first Tweet while keeping everything we've talked about in The One Person Business in mind.

Pay attention to how other people post. Start making connections on why it does well. Use it as inspiration for your own posts. Keep it problem and benefit focused. 

**Get in the habit of posting once a day minimum.**

If you have to stay up until 2am trying to think of a post, do it. I did that many times. If I didn't have a post ready for the next day (and didn't get one written) I considered myself a failure. **I _could not_ lose any momentum.**

- [ ] Make a system for writing Tweets based on the works here and in other resources
- [ ] Clean up you X (Twitter) account so that it is clean and ready
- [ ] Set a posting target for your Tweets, you need to push heavy
- [ ] Create a project checklist of [[Post 100]] on X (Twitter)
- [ ] Link your previous newsletters to your website
- [ ] Make your logo about breaking the loop as a future project
#### Step 03 –– DM One Person You Want To Connect With
This is more about **overcoming the fear of people** being "so far ahead of you."

**Remember, likability.**

If you can compliment someone on their work, be interested in _them,_ and **offer the value you can (even if its just a resource you came across relating to what they are working on)** — they will like you.

**Start small.**
