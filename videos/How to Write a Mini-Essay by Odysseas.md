Mini-essays are a tool to further develop your ability to write and to think. The process is straightforward and simple. Each essay expresses a single idea and can be written in anyway that you decide. 

The structure follows the format of intro, body, conclusion and must stay between 100-500 words. The intro and conclusion is best limited to 1-2 sentences. This forces you to be specific, clear, and concise.
