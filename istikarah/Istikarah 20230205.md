**Today Istikarah**

  

Am I to leave now this week, pack and get on the road to the states and then to wherever the brother is from the men’s group or do I stay here and try and make life happen? Guide me.

  

Open 71:5 Invitations, this is usually when you have left your place to enter into another. //1-7 You have been invited publicly to a few places, so go take up these offers be sure to note and track these individuals. Allah even mentions flight Subhan’Allah 

1 60:9 Am I making Allies by staying in this place… you don’t practice as you should you stay in fear of doing what is good… oh boy! // 6-11 Reinforcing the being of around believer, and to keep away from the non believers. You are around non believers and with time Allah may make affection between. But you must make the separation and be! 

2 100:4 Ya Allah all that comes to me is travel like a wheel and carriage dust from movement. // Surah It’s time for you to go to battle… you have been in safety for far to long, comfort…poisonous comfort. You need to move… make moves now!!! Pain more pain JIHAD

3 62:1 Doing this being in Jihad is an act of worship, not striving and struggling to live as a Muslim is not worship // Surah Keep to Allah, do not stray hold tight and do not miss your Jumah be with the brothers and seek wealth afterwards. Perhaps I should book a ticket for this Friday then…

Close 92:12 This is your guidance and it’s a responsibility for you to follow. // Surah Spend of your wealth to purify yourself… where you are is not pure, you are not living in purity you must do this. Get back to your night prayers as well!
