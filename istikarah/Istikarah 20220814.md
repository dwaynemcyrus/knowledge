**August 14** 

  

How do I get out of my way? 

  

Open 114:2 (1-6) this a reminder of who’s really in charge? For me to be sure to acknowledge that Allah is the one to finally solve this problem for you.

  

Better yet, I need to read more An Nas !!! 

  

25:43 (42-44) Stop making these thoughts and overthinking as your god. Controlling your very days and actions by the second. 

You need to remember and internalize this. Allah is your one and only God and your every part of your being requires Allahs persmission. 

  

13:25. (22-28) you said you will do the work you wrote your agreement to Allah in your plan A. You have broken it, by not working it. Same goes for your lives and doing right by the community. Fight for your word! 

  

30:59 (58-60) here Allah is speaking on patience again, in the additional versus. To break my over thinking I need to implement my studies and routine around Quran And Sunnah.
