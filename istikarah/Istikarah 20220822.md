Open 87:14 stop idolize h the past and what you been through! 

  

57:25 Quran your history as Muslims and the stories of the prophets learn from them! 

  

48:7 gratitude remember who has you alive each and every day and who you are returning to in the end of your life her in earth 

  

90:16 you are poor and holding on to dust of the life and person you were when there’s clearing better for you in Allahs plans!
