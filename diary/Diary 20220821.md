Tawbaw made this morning! 

  

**Tahajjud**

  

Make me completely self-sufficient as a speaker, consultant, creator, and artist. Allow me to make Hijra to New York while taking care of my mother and sister financially.

  

Make me a warrior, a man of discipline, flexibility, intelligence, strength, and power. Give me what I need to become the man I am in my heart for the betterment of myself, my two wives, and the Ummah. 

  

Make me let go of the cage and reigns I hold myself under, give me courage to do what I must. I want to experience the Dragon inside, I need to become the most dangerous of men possible. I need to become the top 0.1% of all men in this dunya, to be the example, and lead my Ummah.

  

I submit and pledge myself to your will, I will do the work so provide me with provision, Ameen.
