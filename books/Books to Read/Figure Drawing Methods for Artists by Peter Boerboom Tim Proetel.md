description: Simple methods teach how to draw figures. When we try to draw a person, we are quickly confronted with various challenges. The proportions need to be correct, the attitude must be clear and vivid, the face should show resemblance and also be expressive. Such a task takes courage. Yet a little practice and training quickly lead to the ability to draw figures in a wide variety of styles with just a few key characteristic strokes. Figure Drawing Methods for Artists shows both beginners and experienced artists how to do just that. At the center of this collection is not the perfect figure, but the joy of drawing, and how, with simple methods, drawing people is possible. By reducing a work to a few lines, using clear contours and simple surfaces, the human figure emerges, constructed and elaborated.
