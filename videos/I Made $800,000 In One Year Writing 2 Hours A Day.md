### Why Writing

- Media drives sales, and writing is the foundation of media
- Writing becomes (transforms into) YouTube video (script), Tweets, Articles, etc.
### The 9 Steps to Becoming a Profitable Writer
1. Choose the topic you cannot stop talking about
	- Write out the following:
		- Your favourite books
		- Your YouTube watch history
		- Your favourite social media accounts
		- What you would write about if money wasn’t an issue
	- *“Good writing is about energy transfer, everyone can write”*
2.  Brainstorm a unique perspective, novelty gets attention, attention is what you need
	- **Novelty:** the quality of being new, original, or unusual
	- *“People need to be reminded with something new”*
	- Develop a novel perspective, by speaking from your personal perspective
3. Write your 1000 words
	- How do you structure it?
		- Paint a picture of the problem and how it affects someone’s life
		- Talk about your personal experiences with it
		- Give step-by-step advice on how to solve the problem
	- *“Actionable advice is how you build an audience at the start to prove your worth and value”*
4. Signup for a newsletter service
	- Keep the use of it to be simple understanding how direct response works is important, but not necessary for this work as it gets in the way
	- Use a content ecosystem:
		- 1 newsletter a week
		- Upload the newsletter as a blog
		- 1 thread condensed from the newsletter
		- 3 Tweets a days from the ideas in the newsletter
	- Turn the content from the ecosystem into:
		- YouTube video scripts
		- LinkedIn posts
		- instagram carousel
		- Reels
		- TikToks
		- A podcast
	- Under all of your posted content you link your blog post as it’s the best place to promote products and services as it’s a positioning of authority
5. Repurpose the actionable part of the newsletter
	- Actionable and in-depth advice is the most potent and beginner friendly way to position yourself as an authority at the start
	- Don’t be to clever when no body knows who you are
	- Your favourite lifestyle YouTubers – *“They gave actionable advice in an [[eternal market]].”* 
6. Learn how to network and grow on the platform
	- [ ] Watch his video on networking [[The Non-Needy Networking Process]]
	- You wont win the social media game if you don’t understand the game and it’s rules
	- Getting views on your content must be done manually to begin with, there’s no way around this
	- You need both good content and eyes on that content.
		- Readers sharing your writing
		- Network with similar follower accounts and growing together
		- Commenting on larger accounts so people can see your comment and click to your profile
		- Make your newsletter so good that people can’t help, but talk about it
		- Join a community and meet people doing the same as you, like Modern Mastery
		- You need to do both and your brand cannot have any holes. If they do, you need to fix it.
7. Turn Ideas into impactful tweets
	- [ ] Watch his unlimited ideas content video, to learn how to write better tweets
	- Create lists, make 2-5 (ie. 5 reasons to get into body building), then turn the points within that list into their own lists which you only do once a week as you will be rotating content based on your newsletter
8. Develop a writing system
	- Take out a notebook
	- Study writing & social media frameworks
		- Writing examples:
			- PAS (Problem. Amplify. Solution)
			- AIDA (Attention. Interest. Desire. Action)
			- PASTOR (Problem. Amplify. Story. Testimony. Offer. Resolution)
		- Social media examples:
			- DM people to network with them
			- Comment on larger accounts
			- TIP: Take a basic social media course and you will be fine
	- Write down a process you can test to write newsletters, tweets, etc.
	- Test it daily and refine it when you hit a roadblock
	- Create systems, step-by-step things that you will do on a daily basis to do things better. This way when you hit a problem you can properly diagnose and make changes until you find a solution
	- Eventually you will have a system that gets you so much results that you can in-turn monetize it as a product or milk it for results
	- You ease  and decrease the mental expenditure (mental load) by improving in incremental steps. This is how he went from 4 hours of writing down to 1-2 hours because the system has become second-nature.
9. Branch out to different platforms
	- His newsletter is the script for his YouTube videos
	- Writes scripts for the reels to grow on TikTok, YouTube shorts, Instagram
	- Writing is the most impactful thing, because everyone can read and easily make use of the content
	- Branching out is how you grow faster
	- This takes time! It’s been a 2-3 year journey for him before he made it to the 6 figure mark
	- **BONUS:** Offer a product for others early on so that you can make some money while you learn
## The Work
### Step 01
- Favourite books: productivity, self-mastery, creativity as a visual artist, mental models, psychology, Qur’an
- YouTube watch history: storytelling, mind setting, developing wealth, masculinity, art tutorials, Islam, motivational talks, documentaries
- Favourite social media accounts: Relationship dynamics, islamic quotes, visual artists, mental models
#### What would you write about if money was not an issue?
- Write about personal development and mindset/soft skills mastery after trauma
- Realities of masculinity, who we are, what we experience, etc.
- Being an artist, and developing the career along with technical knowledge
- Islam, being a new Muslim and figure it all out, along with sharing the fundamentals and the common issues that everyday Muslims face
#### The topic you will move forward it
> “**Self-development is the actions leading to self-mastery and self-actualization**. Self-mastery is the ability to recognize, understand, control, and make the most out of your physical, mental, emotional, and spiritual self. It is gained thorough awareness, understanding, and control over thoughts, emotions, and actions.”

The journey of self-actualization after a life of trauma.
### Step 02
My perspective is that of a male survivor of adult and childhood sexual abuse as new Muslim man of colour.
### Step 03
The problem? How to start living a new life after trauma
The Picture? Unfulfilled, knowing and feeling of cource but not understanding why, excitement and fear of the possibilities
Personal Experience?
Steps to solving the problem? get selfish and decide on a vision for yourself, not a choice. don’t stress how to get thier, as long as you can envision it, you can achieve it or you would n’t have imagined it // have a written vision of this life do not go past 10 years from now // feel it
