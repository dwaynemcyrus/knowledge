  - Submission to Men’s Work
---
## The Direction
I am submitting myself to the work you have given me to do. I have allowed the whispers of the devil to plant seeds of doubt and confusion. The answer has been in front of me all this time, written by my own hand with your guidance. 

Today I submit myself to leading men towards righteous living as an artist, writer, and coach. I will develop the skills required to offer the best of service as my form of worship and gratitude for my life. 

I will fight now.

I ask that you give me signs through the Qur’an that this is good for me or bad for me. Ameen.

## The Response

### First: Almsgiving
107:1 This seems to start off as a warning, please give me more clarity.

107:1-7 (Surah) Be mindful in your work, do not show off seek to help at all times. Like the Prosperous Coach book says, to give. Do more charity, push yourself to help the men. Seek the out.

### Second: The Sovereignty 
67:16 Be secure in the knowledge that Allah SWT can do anything at any point of time. But please give me more knowledge as you know in my heart I am doubtful and scared. 

67:13-19 It is time that you believe in Allah, and push yourself to do. To become to create. God is the one who gives your breathe every single moment, returns your soul at night. Do you not see, following in God is your sovereignty.
### Third: The Power, Fate
97:4 God has been speaking to you. Sending you signs and messages of what to do. You only receive direction from God, but the self-doubts and self-hurt is from the whispers of Satan.

Be mindful, your Creator speaks to you. You only need to follow, and not stop.

97:1-5 (Surah) This is your work. Doubt it no more.

## The Reflection
Giving big and small is how you will achieve sovereignty and this work with men has been decreed for you to do. You know this and there has been plenty of signs. There is no more room for doubt, it is only time to act.

Today, now. Remove all of the distractions and move as God intended.
