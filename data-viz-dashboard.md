## Vision
A proof of synthesis between **design clarity** and **data logic** â€” built to show how raw information can become visual intelligence.

## Core Features

- Theming system following design-system tokens.  
- Dashboard layout optimized for responsiveness and accessibility.

## Technical Highlights

- Data mocked in JSON / fetched from open APIs.  
- Visualizations powered by **Chart.js** or **D3**.  
- Styled with **Tailwind CSS** using systemized variables.
