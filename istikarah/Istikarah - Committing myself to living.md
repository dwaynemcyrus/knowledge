How do I commit myself to living? Ya Allah SWT I am sabotaging myself and I need it to stop, please… help me! 

Open
74:33 — Retreat at night, I’m going to take this as going to sleep
First
72:9 — I used to sit and hear myself and God speak to me in my morning pages, I have shut down that form of communication 
Second
41:15 — Ya Allah SWT am I being arrogant? I think I am… Now that I looked it up I have weird relationship with the word. I am confident in what I can do, however I am fearful of the doing. Perhaps I need more arrogance…
Third
95:2 — Prophet Musa and where he spoke to Allah SWT on [[Mount Sinai]]. You need to establish again proper communication with Allah SWT through your writings and prayers. You NEED this! 
Close
29:37 — DO NOT deny what has been written here, what Allah SWT has guided you with today. Again, DO NOT deny it.

Conclusion
- Get back to writing your morning pages
- Fight more to keep and be present in your prayers
- Go to sleep at night at a proper time, no more lateness
