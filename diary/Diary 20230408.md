Love who you are, it’s the only you that you’re going to get. 

  

Seriously…

  

Think about it. 

  

You are the ONLY you. There’s no one else like and never will there be anyone else like you. 

  

Do not waste your time beating up yourself because you are learning to live life. 

  

We all make bad decisions. End up in unsavoury situations. And have faults.

  

That is no reason to turn on yourself, ever. 

  

I don’t care what anyone else has to say or has said to you. 

  

You are worthy and DESERVING of loving yourself!
