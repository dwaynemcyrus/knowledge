description: Harness the power of your subconscious to create a life you desire! The Power of Your Subconscious Mind teaches us how to remove the subconscious obstacles that prevent us from achieving the success we wish for. In this book, bestselling author Joseph Murphy asserts that life events are actually the result of the workings of our conscious and subconscious minds. He suggests practical techniques through which one can change one’s destiny, principally by focusing and redirecting this miraculous energy. In these pages are the ways in which one can unleash the extraordinary mental powers to acquire self-confidence, attain professional success, create wealth, build harmonious relationships, overcome fears, get rid of bad habits and promote overall well-being and happiness. Covering a variety of topics from healing to academia to riches, the author cites numerous compelling examples of the power of our thoughts and beliefs in influencing our reality. When we change our thinking and prepare our subconscious mind, we change our destiny. Joseph Murphy was an American author and New Thought minister, ordained in Divine Science and Religious Science. A popular speaker, Murphy lectured on both American coasts and in Europe, Asia, and South Africa. Murphy is considered one of the pioneering voices of affirmative-thinking philosophy.
