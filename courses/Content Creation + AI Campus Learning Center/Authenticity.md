## Being Yourself
- Authenticity is the foundation of the 4 attributes.
- Being emotive without authenticity comes across awkward.
- We as humans are naturally repulsed by people who are not authentic.

It’s import to link feelings to the words you use.

You know when you are being authentic when you feel stronger while speaking, when you are acting you feel weaker.
## Connection
- You want to speak as though you are finally getting something off your chest.
- Self-connection/integration is needed, this is when you feel what it is you are saying
## Purpose 
Practical Exercise No.1: Talk about your why/purpose, what motivates you, what drives you. Make use of the following format hook, 3 points, outro. Pay attention to your feeling of authenticity.
