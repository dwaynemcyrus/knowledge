## Akhirah
Leading men who have been abused to a better way of life while potentially giving them reason to look into Islam through my story and character.
### Problems
This is a list of the major issues you see in the world that this work is meant to address over the years:
- The rates of male suicide is extremely problematic 
- Masculinity in boys and men are under heavy siege creating weak and dangerous men
- More and more men are isolated and living as “lone wolves” which is causing great mental health issues
- Addictions to porn, drugs, work, etc.
- Intimacy between men is now a lost and villainized way of life 
- Men no longer understand or are trained in grooming, fashion, and image
- We are lacking good leaders and role models 
- Men are killing themselves more and more
## Vision
A global system and network of men, all engaged and in positions of leaderships for other boys & men via the internet and in person across languages and beliefs. The rights of passage has been brought back to modern society amongst the boys and young men. Men only systems, facilities, education, and human resources are a core part of society, supporting boys & men of abuse & various forms of trauma.
### Impact After Death
19% of men have returned to their roots of masculinity as leaders and are teaching the younger boys and men through Rights of Passage. The mental health of men is taken seriously by other men with systems, facilities, and people doing the work to keep our men from committing suicide.
My community lives on and maintains the morales and values I have set fourth. Chapters can be found around the world where men come together to heal and grow.
