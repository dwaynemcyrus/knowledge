#### The Story (HSO - get t o know me personally and why I know what I'm talking about)
Subject Line: The piece that saved me. I was ready to end it all.

As creatives we are extremely expressive. 

Our voice needs to be heard. But what happens when you can't speak? 

This happened to me at the worst of times. I became silent. 

To this day it remains one of the most beautiful and game changing experiences of my life.

**I rediscovered access to my voice!**

Laying on my floor face up and silent like a murder scene from a crime film. Surrounded by rolls of crumpled paper littered the space.

Some with many marks and hints of genius, others with nothing but a single line.

I was done. The madness was over.

Months prior I had received the opportunity to create a piece for a major big exhibit. My very first showing. The opportunity of a life time. 

My wife was onboard, my kids understood. These next few months was my chance to finally be seen as the artist I have always known to be. To release my genius unto the world. 

My time was precious, my time was now.

Everything was going well, immediately after the 9-5 I would spend an hour or two with the family then lock away in my makeshift studio. Absolute genius was being crafted. My greatest works to be born.

This is what I wished as happening. 

Instead, I was struggling. 

Nothing was being born, it was a horriflic flick on repeat and I was always the victim. Every night was an endless game of half-way ideas and murdered moments of inspiration. 

I just couldn’t keep myself focused. Not long enough to see anything through. I was stuck in a maze of my own making with no way out.

Time passed...lots of it.

I could no longer fake the smiles and dodge the eager curiosities of my wife. Ready to call it quits I finally told my wife the truth. 

"I have nothing to show, the dream is over. I quit."

We sat and spoke she reminded me of my past works. Telling me, "This is not new, you have been here before." 

She was right, I had been many times, I just forgot. I allowed anxiety and the pressure to cloud my judgement and to dismiss what has always worked. 

I went back to the fundamentals.

The one's we all dismiss and the tools of the "secret" of the Great Masters.

That final week before the deadline was exhilarating and truly exhausting. I had thrown clay, expressed with color, and plastered the walls with the blueprints for what would later be called “The Years Most Invigorating Piece”.

Click here to see what was created.

PS: Look for me next week and I'll share with you the tools I used to got there.

#### Value and Belief Shift (DIC)
Subject Line: Systemized Creativity for Maximized Expression

Ever wonder what it looks like to gain near instant control of your mind and wield it like the Great Masters?

We are told the act of creativity is chaotic, free flowing, random moments of inspiration that strike us like lightening. This is **not** the full picture.

Creative access is not a mysterious ability that a select few artists are born with.

We have more control than we want to admit. We wait and fight, and wait again for the next steps to just appear. For our minds to set free the next stroke to make.

This is laziness and not the path to greatness. 

Success is forged. 

A plan of attack is what's needed. One that consistently brings you closer and closer to your most inspired and freed thinking. 

Limitless creativity is what we are all after.

What you require is a process, one that's flexible and repeatable.

I learned this the hard way, through trial and error. It was process, a funnel of iteration, actions on repeat. Every step revealing the next into a system of pathways pushing me towards success.

I documented the journey and have made simple for you to repeat and mold to your own voice and way of creation.
