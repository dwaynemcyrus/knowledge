It is now time to show up and help a business and you have 2 options

## Picking A Market
### Markets & Niches
- You need to think of the different markets and businesses that you want to work with
- You are not married to a market or niche until you are paid
- Start with what you will enjoy
- Look under the big groups: health, wealth, relationships
### What Makes A Good Niche?
- All markets are based on a dominate human desire
- You want a niche that holds a strong desire with customers who have the money (executive coaches, art educators, mental health workers, content and product creators, authors, Luxury status brands like art dealers gallerists, watch makers, fragrances)
- As long as there is a strong desire and businesses making money servicing those desires you can work there
### Is The Market "Saturated"?
- Competition is rarely an actual problem as most people are lazy, fail to execute
- You want to be in a [[Red Ocean Market]] over a [[Blue Ocean Market]]
- You focus is to enter into places where there is competition and present yourself in an innovative manner that is valuable and unique
### Global Vs. Local Markets
- There are business who sell in a global markets
- There are business that sell locally like a gym or restaurant
- You can make time to sit with local business like a chiropractor once you have found success you can repeat the formula across multiple customers in other geographies
- Global markets have scale built-in by default
### Using AI To Find Good Markets
- ChatGPT is a powerful tool to help you get access to this information
- Prompt: Give me 22 sub niches under the category of wealth
### Analyze The Top Players In The Market
- Find the top 3 and analyze everything about their business.
- Know their funnels, avatar, language, sales pages, etc.
- It is recommended that you take 1-2 days doing this as it will yield the world of results, and arm you to service others.
### Mission – Analyze A Top Player
1. Pick a Niche/Market you'd like to work with  
2. Find a brand in that market that appears to be doing well (Lots of followers/positive reviews)  
3. Perform an in-depth analysis to identify the reasons for their success and opportunities for other brands using [this document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1E9hxRSRrOdTy7a25mi9fG0yvZx-hJAevbvcKwwk-NZ0/edit?usp=sharing).
## Finding A Good Business To Partner With
### Look For Ingredients For Success
- With your analysis complete and your list of cool ideas to help a business grow you will begin to search for business that have the ingredients for success
- You want a business that already has an engaged and established audience
- They need to already have a product that they are selling
- If you are going for a local business, have a large social media following is not as important however their reputation and positive reviews is
### How To Search For Good Businesses To Partner With
- Now you go out into the wild, you only need 10 to start with
- Make use of social media like YouTube to find businesses 
- You need to think, “What would this business put out online and/or in their bio”
- You can also use Yelp to seek out these businesses
- LinkedIn sales navigator is another tool you can use
- You want to find businesses who will fit the ideas you have to grow a business
### Use AI To Speed Up Your Search
For example you are searching the niche of “energy healing”

Prompt: Give me 32 search terms I can use on YouTube to find content businesses in the energy healing niche.
### Example Search On Social Media
1. Search “How to do a planche for beginners”
2. Choose a profile, and check there About
3. Evaluate for indicators of success 
4. Once the success markers are present its time to gather information for your reaching out
### Example Search For Local Market Businesses
Be sure to make use of Yelp, Google Maps, and Google Business
1. Visit Yelp and choose a location, doesn’t have to be your own, restaurants are not good, think massage parlours, chiropractors, etc. you want high-margins
2. Check the review ratings you want the highest ones, keep in mind those who are paying money to show at the top are good indicators as this means they have money
## Start the Conversation
### Things to Remember Before You Start
- There is no magic template to send out and get money
- There are key principles to building your own
- Remember you are NOT a copywriter who trades words for money, you are a strategic partner who provides outcomes (growth, revenue, etc.)
- You are a digital marketer who can 10x a business within two years
- Do not act desperate, in turns off people
### Digital Presence and Trust
- When you reach out, these businesses will search you on Google to learn more about you
- Have built out LinkedIn profile with content as a Digital Marketing Consultant or Growth Consultant
- Have a separate Instagram profile that speaks to you as a digital grown consultant
- A portfolio website is necessary to set your perceived authority and you will want to make use of spec work. You can make use of Destiny and your other businesses to be examples of copy written etc.
### Offer Something They Want
- Before you reach out you need to have something that you can offer them to help with
- Have an hypothesis for how it is you can help them
- The initial conversation needs to be valuable to them, offer them something that they want
- What you offer needs to connect with what they care about and will be helpful to them
### Personalization Is Key
- You must personalize the outreach, it must only make sense to them
- Remember you want to invest in them so that they will invest in you
- Reference something about their business that is unique to them so that they see reason to pay attention to you
- Again, your message cannot make sense in anyone else inbox
### Make Believable Claims
- You want to acknowledge their dream outcome
- You do not want to claim you can make something happen that you cannot
- Remember you do not know if this person is even a fit, you are just getting to the know them
### Two Main Strategies
1. Start the conversation, give a compliment, and then go for the offer
2. You can reach out and make the offer upfront

A good technique is to give a screenshot of how you would improve some of their work or by provided a sample of how their copy can be improved or what you would write.
### How To Pick What You Offer Them
- You should already have knowledge about the niche and the business’ dream state
- Think about what their funnel may be missing, or shift in their messaging for improvement that is directly connected to their desires
- You do not want to offer the same service to every business like a low value copywriter
- Remember you are making a hypothesis, own it in your communications
### What Is Your Objective For The Outreach Messages?
- What you want is for them to enter into a Zoom call with you for a sales call.
- The end of your emails should always be driving them toward a Zoom call to better understand them and whether or not they will be a fit for the initial project
### What Is Your Objective For The Outreach Messages?
- Two reasons they have not responded: bad timing and forgot, or they did not like you message
- You must be intelligent about your followup and do not be desperate
- Typically you want to send your followup email after 72 hours
- The last followup is to be a walk away email after 7 days letting them know you are done with following up on them while still keeping the door open
- The re-engaged followup will be in the next 3 months with a new solution on offer if they still fit.
### How To Handle Questions And "Not Interested" Replies Like A G
- You cannot change their mind, stay cool and happy, them save them as a followup in the next 3-6 months
- If they ask about your pricing it can only be given on a sales call as you need to understand their problem 
- Always parlay anything outside of a rejection into a push for a sales call
- You are looking for a business to partner with that is a good fit
### Impact vs Quantity
- Quality is way more important than quantity
- Scale is not the answer
- Highly targeted outreach is the only way
- You are the expert, you are the one who has the answers, you must maintain you status, carefully select 
### Mission – Outreach
1. Find a business with the ingredients for success
2. Come up with a hypothesis of something that could help them achieve their goals
3. Write a personalized outreach message to them following the principles in the lessons. Aim for maximum impact
4. Send your message via email or social media DM
## Closing the Deal
### Sales Calls Objectives
- The purpose is to get to know their goals, desires, and what they have done
- Afterwards you will position yourself as the one who can solve their problem
- Do not go in trying to hard push, you will recommend a specific course of action
### Rapport Leads To Riches
- Start with greeting them as a person and know them very slightly to check the vibe
- If you get on the call and you find that something is off, end the call
- Zoom calls are great as it gives you the face to face to further build rapport
Appearance Matters
- Have good posture, be big open and tall
- Groom yourself, have a fresh cut and shave
- You do not need a suit, nor do you need to overdress, a collar shirt is good as it frames your face
- You want good lighting so make use of a ring light, natural light, etc
- Your back drop need to be clean and clear
- Be calm and relaxed in your speech, you are the professional
### "Doctor Frame" And Important Questions
- You are the doctor, you diagnose before your recommend a solution
- As a strategic partner in their business you must understand them
- Prescription before diagnosis is malpractice
- Position your brand and self as a doctor of marketing
### Situation Questions
The S in “SPIN”, these are the first questions that you want to ask to understand where they want to go and who they are.
- Ask about their goals, target market
- Where are they, where do they want to go
- Plan out these questions and how they can be asked in different ways
- Always show them that you are paying attention
- Find ways to confirm that you were listening to them by making commentary on their answers or including the answers into the next part of the conversation
### Problem Questions
The P in “SPIN”, these are the question to understand the gaps and challenges that they are facing.
- Ask what they have tried before
- Why they think something did not work
### Implication Questions
The I in “SPIN”, these are the question to help them see the consequences of solving and not solving the problem.
- What would your business look like if you don’t solve the lack of sales in this aspect of the value ladder product
- How is this problem affecting other areas of the business
- You always want to ask 3-4 of these question to really emphasize the need to get these problems solved.
### Needs/Payoff Questions
The I in “SPIN”, these are the question to help set you up for pitching your product.
- What would the payoff be in solving these problem, “What would the payoff be if you were to solve this problem in terms of revenue or value to the business?”
- You want to shift their thinking from an annoying problem to a problem of value.
### Discovery Project
- Now you want to give a summary of the SPIN and then recommend all they need to do to achieve their goals, then you say, “instead of all of this and a full $5k retainer or $10k funnel rebuild, lets start with the first step of a $700 in order to get to know if we are a good fit before I jump into bed with you”
### How To Price Your Services
- Professor will not give us a pricing table, he wants us to be paid for the value we provide, not the words written or  time or deliverables
- You area  strategic partner NOT a commodity
- If you help a business make $100,000 you want to make $10k, you help a business make $1m, you make $100k
- The needs/payoff questions should have given you a pretty good sense of cost. When we do this project how much $ should it bring in and then you price 10% of that
- Your Discovery needs to be around $1000 dollars nothing less than $800, always be ready to refund the money should they not like this
- An effective way to do this can be on performance, they earn then pay you
### How to Handle Objections
- In must cases after SPIN there shouldn’t be an objective
- Typically 3 reasons for this
	- They don’t like or trust you, you may need to restructor the deal
	- They don’t like the plan, use your research of how its working for other big players as proof
	- They dont have any money, end the call, they are not your market
### Manage Your Emotions
- Always stay calm confident and in control you have the answers
- Relax sit back and ask your questions
- Remember this is a collaborative effort 
- You know that there are many who seek to work with you, you are not desperate
- You must remain in the emotional state of calm relaxed and in the know about what you are doing
### What To Do When They Say Yes
- You want to lay out the rest of the process for the discovery project: invoice sent, information gathering from the client (testimonials, avatar, products, target market, etc), spend 2-3 days analyzing the information, first draft which will be rough wont match your voice, then we enter into revision to match your voice, align with your audience and fit your brand it will be a back and forth to fine tune the message, revision complete we go into launch and implementation by me or your team, we will have a  review call after a week or two to review and send the second invoice and during that call collect testimonial or adjust the discovery project until it works and pitch the next project.
