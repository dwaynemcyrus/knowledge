**Today August 10**

  

How do I stop sabotaging myself? I’m sorry! 

  

Open 

25:57: stop thinking that you have to give Allah something and gain his permission or rather the peoples permission to do what Allah has given you to do! 

  

34:13: put in the work that you know you need to do, you already know it! You just have to do it and be grateful in that doing and opportunity! 

  

35:10: wrap your life around Allah the way you have planned and trust that Allah will make this work for you in this life because you are putting the honour of your Creator first! 

  

69:5 (1-8) you cried before this…but I do not know what this means Allah!
