## Summary

## Handouts
### You are learning how Business is done
The goal is for you to become a business owner.

I do not expect all of you to run Social Media accounts based around Tate forever.

This will be a good business model to make your first million dollars and learn exactly how business is done over 2 years.

Within those two years, you'll have learned

Marketing, Sales and Employee Management

The skills that make kings.

My teaching style is simple.

You learn to fight by fighting.

You learn to make money by making money.

We start you off on a guaranteed, proven business model and show you how to scale it.

And let me give you all a word of caution:

Many of you will quit.

You'll give yourself many excuses to justify it.

Those of you who quit, will never be successful in anything you do.

If quitting is possible within these 30 days, just don't start then.

Anyone who quitting is possible in these 30 days, goodluck with your life, but you should just stop reading now. 

### Those of you still here.
I GUARANTEE if you're serious about making money,

This is better than ANY education on earth.

It starts with $500 in 30 days.

And it ends with $50k a month within 365 days.

My students have done this before.

A student of mine has hit 100k in one month, pure profit.

I haven't even been teaching for even  1 year.

I know how business is done at scale and at world class.

And by the end of the 30 days when you have $500 in your bank account.

You'll have a good glimpse of it too.
