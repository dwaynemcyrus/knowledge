stikarah 

  

Guide me into working for myself and creating my wealth and self-seficiency , how to do this?

  

Open 5:79 Keep yourself away from wrong doing in order to create and earn. Your mind had been going in these directions these past two days especially yesterday if I remember right.

  

1 11:107 Know that Allah is in charge here, of all of it!!! So be greatful… (105-109) Don not complain or do or think in wicked ways about anything, be in good at all times. Keep yourself in good favour with Allah. Continue to make demands of Allah. And do not care what other believe, just do right by Allah.

  

2 74:42 This is a question being asked, I’m going to say me and my lack of making myself seen, using my skills to earn, and not trusting in Allah completely that God will provide (37-47) Be sure to keep your Salat fight to keep them this includes night at prayers for you, make money and feed the poor, do not lie! Remain on the righteousness path in all things 

  

3 35:44 Travel the land and pay attention to what other of success have done and stay away from it. Look to history of great rulers when they get arrogant. Do not be arrogant against Allah in the works you do. Or feel superior to anyone else in a malicious way. 41-45 You are to be punished for earning so stop doing it to yourself.

  

Close 89:8 I don’t understand but the Surah means everything to me for now, get on routine to earn starting with Fajr, because it’s currently off! 1-18 do not be disobedience to Allah! Look at what happens, think Nova!!! Damn… okay good. Ask for help you are not of the poor. When Allah provides for your in bounty be sure to always straighten out your life further
