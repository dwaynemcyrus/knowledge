As much progress as I have made this week, I still have barriers in my mind to deal with.

Embracing the discomfort of freedom creates new challenges.

**The feeling of not being ready.**

It often shows up when I attempt something new. An activity that requires me to stretch and grow who I am and what I know.

Spending way too much time “preparing”, getting ready.

It's just a waste of time and effort.

The busy work, the stalling, the endless search for ways to avoid the pain of growth and the unknowns of success.

I had to remember that I would never attempt an activity that my mind didn’t already believe I could do.

Acknowledging this allowed me to give myself permission to act in my best interest.

And I have.

So you should too!

Sincerely,  
*Dwayne Cyrus*
