Freelancing is the art of providing a service to clients in exchange for moneybags 💰  
  
The best way to start the freelancing process and find clients (and once you've built enough social proof they’ll come to you) is to build your account on social media.   
  
You should build up ONE main platform to start, on the platform that your prospects (potential clients) also have a presence. Too many of you try to build multiple platforms at once without getting even the basics done with one account.   
  
Guarantee your success by building ONE main platform.

## Why Twitter and NOT a freelancing platform (like Fiverr or Upwork) ?   
  
A social media account allows you to take the process into YOUR HANDS. You control the process, you can charge as much as you’re worth, and you’re not competing for time intensive, low pay work. PLUS, you can build a lasting relationship with clients and get paid MORE.   
  
Twitter has millions of users, it’s where I have found my success with email copywriting clients, and there’s an endless amount of leads (prospects) there.   
  
So, now you know WHY, let’s begin 👇

## How to Setup Your Profile
### Profile Anatomy
- Banner to display who you are
- Profile picture needs to be a professional photo that makes it obvious who you are
- A simple hand using your name or a brand name, it need to be simple and easy to say
- Bio needs to speak to the outcomes you create not just “copywriting…” 
- Bio end and link is where you make an offer to a guide, ebook, video series etc and the link to the offer create the Call To Action
#### Header and Profile Pic
- You can use an image that shows social proof or one the gives me context to what your do
- Have a profile picture that says “I am the guy”
- Header should speak to your niche and can be used to promote your offer
#### Bio
- Be professional and here’s an example, “I help influencer add 5-6 figure via email | Email Campaigns | Weekly Emails | Product Launches”
- Don’t write a bio like everyone else, you need to stand out by letting people know how you help them. 
- Make it about the person you want to help. Make it obvious.
- Never specify and outcome that you cannot create, this is how you hurt your reputation.
- Only specify results that you have gotten for other people
- As a newbie your bio can say “check the link for examples of what I have done”
- Tell the audience what you have to offer and how they can benefit from your services
- Make the bio about the person following you
### Business or Personal
- Merging business and personal allows you to build brand an impact spans on the content you offer which make you more relatable 
- A business account limits you in the short and long term.
