### Introduction
Four each day you will need to set aside some time with pen & paper or digital device to think in peace and write undistracted.
### Day One Prompts
- Think of a time when someone said no to you. How did you react? Could you have reacted in a healthier way?
- Think of a time when you wanted to say no but did not. How could you have expressed this boundary?
- How do you think people in your life will respond to your boundaries? Is this based on fact or your own assumptions? What about your past makes you think in this way?
### Day Two Prompts
- Are you surprised by any of the boundaries you have identified today?
- Are there any missing boundaries from your list?
### Day Three Prompts
- How do you think your life will be different once you’ve established healthy boundaries?
- In what relationships have you established healthy boundaries? How do you feel about these relationships? 
- What actions do you take to maintain these healthy relationships?
### Day Four Prompts	
- How do you want to share your chosen boundary with the other person? In person, via text, or by email? Do what feels the most comfortable and appropriate.
- Is your statement assertive? If so, proceed. If not, reconsider how to state your expectation.
- Decide when you want to share your boundary—at least 2 days from now or the next time it’s violated. Write about what it would feel like to have your boundary respected. Again, do what makes you feel most comfortable.
### Day Five Prompts
- What potential challenges or pushbacks you might face when setting your chosen boundary?
- For each challenge, write a response that reinforces your boundary. Use assertive language, keep it short.
- Write a positive affirmation or reminder about the importance of your chosen boundary and place it somewhere visible.
### Day Six Prompts
- Reflect on the past week and write down any situations where you felt a boundary was needed. Record any instances where your boundaries were violated. Describe what happened, how it made you feel, and the impact on your well-being.
- Create a list of boundaries you would like to implement that would improve the relationship you have with yourself.  This will aid you in your recovery and growth into the person you want to be. For example, “Save more money.” Next to each one, identify one actionable step to help you uphold your boundary. Example: “Start a savings account, and add $30 per month to it.”
