## What Is A Business?
- A business is a mutually beneficial exchange of value between two people
- Example: An apple exchanged for a $1
- People tend to group by similar desires and pains often referred to as a market
- You need to find ways to provide as much value as possible to the market
## The Value Equation
- It’s an equation that exemplifies how we as humans interpret what we value
- Value = (Dream Outcome * Perceived Likelihood of Success) / (Effort and Sacrifice * Time Delay)
- Dream Outcome: The more grand the more valuable 
- Likelihood: It’s the perceived success rate of achieving the Dream Outcome
- Effort and Sacrifice: What needs to be given up and how stressful the effort required of me
- Time Delay: How long to desired results, shorter is always better
- The Value Equation must always be used at Every stage of your work
## Two “Levers” of Success
- Give more value or gain more customers these are the levers
- You need to find ways to give customers more
- You need to find ways to attract new customers
## The Value Ladder
- The levers are scale and amount of value 
- Russel Brunson was the first to speak on the Value Ladder… double check this
- Fist step is typically the consumption of content
- Second is the first exchange is a free lead magnet for email
- Third is the low ticket product which is sub $100 with tons of value in it
- Fourth is the Mid ticket product 
- Fifth is the high ticket product
- Your work is in ascending each person as far as possible and as many people as possible up the value ladder
## What Is A Market
- People with the same desires is often called a market
- There are big markets and small defined markets
- You aim is to always find the niches and serve them
- The market always wins, your job is to give them what they want
## Understanding Humans
- You need to understand what motivates people
- You need to understand how humans decide to change
- You need to understand how they make decisions 
## Human “Motivators”
- People take actions based on emotion
- People run towards their desire/pleasure or people run away from pain
- When you truly understand their dreams and desires you are half way there you must also understand the pain of where they are now
- These two emotional forces motivates people to action

## Roadblocks And Solutions
- Most people have already tried to solve their current state and have hit a number of roadblocks they couldn’t get passed and are stock and it’s painful
- You need to ask yourself what is getting in the way of the persona reaching their dream state
- The problem is the roadblock and the other side of this coin is the solution 
- Positioning the product is about having it be described as the solution  to the problem
- The if(solution)/then(problem) statement is what you want to be able to write for when you are describing the problem/solution
## Where Products Fit In
- Products are not the solution, this is the common mistake
- Products are a tool to help you overcome laws of nature to reach your dream state
- Position the product as the tool to get the user to the dream state as quickly and easy as possible
- The product is the bridge that gets them over the roadblock
## Brand and Identity
- Certain products stand apart by providing an identity to the buyer such as watches and cars 
- Some businesses don’t have a problem to solve, they have a status to give and convey to others
- There are branded vs utility products
## Marketing Systems
- Business is about attracting attention and then monetizing that attention 
- Some systems are marketing campaigns, funnels, etc
## How Businesses Get Attention
- We must get attention of the people the businesses is seeking to serve
- 2 ways to get the attention the market is searching and you show up or you interrupt the market while they live their normal life
- The two styles are search (attract) vs interrupt
- Interruption is in two methods: organic vs paid 
## Attention Through Search
- As humans when we have a problem we search for solutions
- On search the first page is most important 
- You earn or pay to gain the attention 
- People will search Yelp, Google, YouTube, TikTok 
## Attention Through Interrupt
- This is about grabbing your attention 
- We focus on Social Media though you can see this on billboards
- Content needs to good!
- Platforms are: YouTube, Instagram, Facebook, TikTok 
- Some interruptions are paid, others are organic (content that is favoured by algorithm)
## What Makes A Human Pay Attention 
- You have to speak on what is valuable to them a dream outcome or a pain to avoid 
- You also need to be different from their feed visually 
- Stand out and provide value to them 
## Mission — Attention
