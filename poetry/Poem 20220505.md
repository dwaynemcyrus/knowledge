New Poem 2

  

You have to fight

I know you are broken

I know you are pain

  

Hell is looking god right now huh

You already in it my friend

War with yourself is the deepest hell you will ever know

  

You are not out

You are down

The only way forward is up! 

  

Pick yourself up and fight 

Fight through your hell

Crawl drag and pull yourself out

  

Be broken

Move yourself forward

This hell is not your home

Reject the comfort of this place

  

Now move!
