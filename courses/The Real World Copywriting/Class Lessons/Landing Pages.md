## How To Model Successful Copy
Congratulations you can now write any form of copy on the planet
- This will allow you to learn any form of copy as it changes constantly in marketing
- The form will always change but the psychology principles remains the same
- As long as you can identify successful copy you can model it. Know what it is that they are doing what’s the skeleton (the different sections of copy)
- Swipe files are great resources
- Ways to do this is to swap out elements from a piece of copy that’s good and works for others and adapt it to function for your avatar
- It’s always good to find successful pieces of copy to model from in your world
- Build your swipe file of webinars, click funnels, newsletters, etc
- Sign up to as many newsletters as possible as a swipe file resource but on a separate email address
- Search successful (high engagement likes, comments, shares) ads on social platforms, also if its long running and they have spent lots of money on it often that indicates a good and functional funnel
- Before you write a landing page after your research, go and look at what others are doing so you can be successful 
## What are opt-in pages
Why are they important and how do you write them?
- The opt-in trade is to collect the users details and get permission to contact them it’s usually the first step on the brand ladder.
- Once you have their contact info you can communicate with them directly.
- There’s many many styles of opt-in pages and that’s fine because you know the elements to write for them which is typically a DIC framework with a dash of authority and trust comments mixed in.
- **Opt-in is also known as a landing page, it is best to position the voice as authoritative.**
- Success is measured by conversion rate and 25% is the bare minimum to have.
- Landing pages are so important as it’s often the beginning of the relationship with a user to be marketed to.
#### Opt-in Headers
- Your consistency with the headline your pages uses to whatever the hook/fascination is meant to keep them connected.
- The header is often a big promise to solve and provide something, this fascination needs to be potent and rock the readers brain, powerful! So good that they will speak to their fiends about it.
#### Opt-in Curiosity Bullets
- You want to build enough of the intrigue about what is on the other side of submitting their info, that they will be haunted if they never opt-in
- Fascinations are also called curiosity bullets
- Stacking curiosity bullets build intrigue and curiosity and each bullet is so good that the reader wants all of them
- Insert some authority and build trust which is highly important especially for those who are unfamiliar with you which is most people. Show your track record, name drop, etc you covered this earlier in the boot camp here (link it)
- Increasing authority gives them confidence in the big promise of the header

## Assignments
You are going to think of an idea for a free gift for an Opt In Page that would be attractive for the avatar you created and researched for this Sales Page  

[https://drive.google.com/file/d/1q8Y1PKpvrA985L3KE5RosykNn6_gv7Uu/view?usp=sharing](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1q8Y1PKpvrA985L3KE5RosykNn6_gv7Uu/view?usp=sharing)

For example you could decide that a good free gift would be a free "10 tips to replicate genius level creativity at work" PDF guide.

Once you have decided on your free gift, go out and find an Opt-in Page you'd like to model,  

Then write out the elements (Headline, Intrigue Elements, Authority Elements) for an Opt In Page for your free gift in a Google Doc.

### Example
Here is an example of what the completed mission should roughly look like.

There is not one right or wrong way to complete the mission, this is just an example for you to measure your work against as you progress through the Bootcamp.
