So I need a plan to earn $32k USD per month.

Let’s brainstorm how to monetize what you already have, there’s no need to start fresh. 
- Push subscriptions for the TikTok lives which gives access to the private Discord
- Write a paid newsletter for the people 
- Get ad revenue from your YouTube channel
- Become sponsored for your content on YouTube
- Synthesize long form content for other into short form

Keep in mind that there’s active and passive income. You need to generate active cash flow right now. Brainstorm ways in which you can do this, and do not start from scratch, look at what currently have and have done in the past.

2 > 4 > 8 > 16 > 32

Writing and art,

How?
- Sell art online and take commissions
- Copywriting and ghostwriting
