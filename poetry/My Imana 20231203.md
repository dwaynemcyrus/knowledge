Title: My Imana

  

The grand of my soul

The women of my teen

  

Our souls here met before

Here we met again

  

My life in your hands

My future in your eyes

  

Your presence in my life

The best use of my time

  

A soul of Allah sent to heal mine

  

To save my mind from myself

To heal my wounds from this life

  

The lighthouse to my creator  
  
A cover for the sadness

A place for me to hide

  

My Imana

  

My trust from the creator divine
