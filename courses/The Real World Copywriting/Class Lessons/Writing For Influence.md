	- What is the one key roadblock that was fixed will allow them to move forward toward their dream outcome?
- Pay attention to what they are not talking about

## Weaponizing Attention and Curiosity
He who controls the Dopamine, controls the Universe
- How to grab their attention and direct them
- The first battle you have to win is their attention in the communication game
- So how do we stand out in this battlefield of attention?
	- You need to break the pattern, find a way to be different from the environment 
	- **You want to present one of two things Opportunity (Something they want) or Threat (Something they fear) whichever is most interesting to break the pattern**
	- Whichever you choose there needs to be a pot of dopamine at the end of it to hit the pleasure neurotransmitters. This is released when there’s something cool happening, but also when you are chasing something good. Example: scrolling by social media for the one post that stands out! When they find it, the brain gives a hit of dopamine which is an activity experience. Similar to back in the day when hunters were out searching for prey and would find it
	- You want to tease them into seeking out the rest of the dopamine hit, 
	- Whenever you present something to catch their attention, they need to know there’s a reward on the other side (dopamine), teasing that there is something valuable or dangerous or relevant to them down the line with your subject line and you need to tap into that
	- **Dopamine is what makes the world go around, we live in an attention based society, he who gives people dopamine in the right way, you have them doing whatever you want.** 
	- If you can dangle dopamine and have them chase some sort of future payoff (the reward and hit) you win
	- Adding curiosity, mystery, and intrigue are like dumping gasoline on the fire and if you can add that to your work you got them
### How do you engineer curiosity? 
This is about getting people to think there’s a hit here.
- **Curiosity comes from information. An information gap creating a low level of anxiety (that eats at the person) that can only be resolved by answering the unanswered questions.** Something they don’t know, they may have a little bit of knowledge, but it is not complete, it’s a misunderstanding that they have. 
- This feeling of it eating away at your mind (the thing you don’t know) it leaves you at the edge of your seat. This is similar to that of a cliffhanger in a show. It’s why people binge watch shows and are waiting months for a new season or movie sequel.
- Have curiosity, mystery, and intrigue in everything that you write, within each step you want them to get a hit, it’s how you lead people. 
### Things that enhance curiosity.
#### Specificity
It needs to feel real in their mind. The more specific details you can share without giving away the answer the better. “10 steps you must take to hit 10k on IG” having a number and being specific enough without giving everything. 
#### Not Statements
The reader is going to have the best guess as to what the “answer” is if you tell him it’s NOT that thing… they’re mind will go into overdrive trying to figure it out. People like to guess what the rest is. **A good tactic is to tell people what it’s not to challenge their initial guess.** “It’s not keto, it’s not intermittent fasting, etc” especially when dealing with a sophisticated reader. You want the reader to think this is not what I thought it would be so let me find out what it is.
3. Borrowed Status/Mystery. Secrets. Illuminati. Elon Musk. Ancient Knowledge. Humans gravitate to the secret and high status. Humans gravitate to the high status, the occult, the secret, so if you can connect it to something big and powerful, old and interesting, inherently you gain a lot of value. Secrecy with a big name connected to it creates mass appeal as well.
4. Unexplainable. If the reader can’t quite figure out how something has happened (only if they think it’s real) they will have to try and figure it out. If you can present a map of reality to show people how to achieve real results it creates a search for the human to human connect, like “teach me, share the knowledge”. You want to give them proofs about something they do not understand about the world, peak their interest to want to know what it is you know. Give them a real thing to figure out.
- **Win the battle for their attention, and then keep them hooked with a constant drip of curiosity.** And there is no limit to what you can get your reader to do. Tease these humans with new mystery, new curiosity, and you can get them to go from not knowing about you to becoming raving fans. 
- You want to master the ability of building curiosity, and directing your reader’s attention. You need to do this from the beginning right to the end, winning every single battle to be a great copywriter.
## How to Write Fascinations
### The “Lego Blocks” of Copywriting 
- Before you can dive into writing emails landing pages and Facebook ads we need to learn about the smallest of building blocks as a copywriter, fascinations
- If you learn to write killer fascinations you have no problem capturing your readers attention, which is the first and hardest battle
- Mastering the art of fascinations literally will make the reader addicted to you
- What is a Fascination? F**ascination is a short line or two that combines desire with intrigue to create a potent effect in the mind of the reader.** And written well makes the reader rabbid to read the rest of your work and take action at the end. **You want to combine the thing they care about with intrigue, a specific tease, with a curiosity element is how you do it right. It creates a splinter in their mind.**
- Examples to get a feel of what this is like:
	- Headline the teachers favorite, “ wife of famous movie star swears under oath her new perfume does not contain an illegal sexual stimulant!”, there’s drama, specificity, intrigue, we need to now know what this perfume is.
	- “My weird hashtag strategy that helped me grow by 52,000 followers in one month!”, another headline. Specific details that one would care a lot about along with some mystery.
	- “Amazing secret discovered by one legged golfer adds 50 yards to your drives, eliminates hooks and slices… and can slash up to 10 strokes from your game almost overnight!”, another headline. It’s interesting and intrigues it just cannot be ignored by golfers. 
- Essentially all fascinations have two main elements
	1. An implied opportunity or threat
	2. Specific details that make a reader think that there’s something real on the other side, with enough information to create an information gap. If you are the Avatar you need to be compelled to solve the **fascination**.
- After research you will do a minimum of 100 fascinations as this is your ammunition 
- As you are out in the world, copy and document fascinations that you see in use
- **When you control curiosity you control attention and in turn control people, get great at fascinations** 

### Fascination Formulas

"If...then..." desire/fear/pain then specificity, curiosity/tease
#### When
Example: *"When eating chocolate will actually boost your fat loss"*
"When" relates to times and is not used as often
#### Quickest, Easiest
Example: *The quickest way to boost your confidence and get that millionaire "glow"*
"Quickest, Easiest" implies novelty and superiority, these adjectives amplify curiosity

"Better than" solution based over product and sets the readers expectations
#### Single
Example: The single step you must take before all of your sales calls to maintain frame and close like the Wolf of Wall Street
"Single" adds importance to the topic, magnifies the importance, makes the information gap they have seem smaller and compels them to want to solve it, and take action

1. **Specificity.** It needs to feel real in their mind. The more specific details you can share without giving away the answer the better.
2. **Not Statements.** The reader is going to have a best guess as to what the "answer" is if you tell him it's NOT that thing... they're mind will go into overdrive trying to figure it out.

## Mission – Fascinations
Pick any piece of copy from the [swipe file](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/11bGJkOSOX6Z7jhkQja1hIGHK9iXeGrXS?usp=sharing](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/11bGJkOSOX6Z7jhkQja1hIGHK9iXeGrXS?usp=sharing)  and write a list of 40 fascinations about that product.

Stretch your brain.  

Be creative.

## The Creative Thinking Process
How to come up with genius ideas and conquer the world 
- Now you get to write, it’s the first time you write
- The quality of your thinking determines the quality of your success
- These concepts and process will allow you to disrupt entire markets, it’s how you change business, the world, and self
- You need to understand your brain and how it functions to produce the most creative works
- There are two parts to your brain 
	- Subconscious mind: the bottom part of the iceberg controls your memories, gives you thoughts, the workhorse, where your creativity lies, math, facts, “phone number memory”
	- Conscious mind will direct the subconscious and is above it
- How they work together
	1. Conscious mind sets the intention, asks the questions 
	2. Sub mind begins to generate ideas, this is divergent thinking
	3. Conscious mind filters the ideas, choosing the best of, this is convergent thinking 
- The process seems simple, but the thinking often breaks apart for a few reasons
	- Distraction: this is where Deep Work is required to keep your momentum going, this is why most people cannot think deeply. Cut out distractions in your life to develop deeper thinking. 
	- Lack of material to work with to begin the creative process: These tends to stem from poor research and preparation, you need clarity on the Avater, Problems, Desires, Roadblocks, Solutions, Product. It’s usually a lack of understanding in the Process of the work (how to do a step) or the lack of material for the work 
	- Too harsh of a filter too early on: if everything you come up with, you bad talk it the sub mind will stop coming by up with ideas. It’s kinda like another person you are dealing with, you kill their motivation. The way to kill this is to turn off the filter by pushing yourself to write 100 horrible fascinations. 
	- The brain is overtaxed: too many deep work sessions, your brain requires time to reset itself, go for a 5 min walk like in *[[The Artist’s Way]]*, filling the well activities like washing dishes 
- Develop this skill of creative thinking and you will never face a challenge you cannot overcome

## How to Evaluate and Improve your Writing
The keys to ensuring quality writing and actually producing results
- This is the part after you write, it’s the key to ensure quality and all writing is meant to achieve a result in the mind of the reader
- It’s not enough to just brain dump, you need to go back and review your writing to ensure it will achieve the results like design
- Writing is an iterative process like the OODA from the first lesson
- Step 1 You need to sit and read your copy out loud in your voice, it allows you to perceive it as though you are the avatar
- Step 2 As you read examine how the reader will be affected. By the reading, our job is to orchestrate the experience. If you reach a point that doesn’t work, reverse engineer, looking for and asking “how can I trigger the effect I want?”
- Step 3 Grammar and spellcheck do this at the end to ensure you have the correct words. Teacher Quote from military, *”How you do the little things is how you do the big things is how you do everything”*. Poor grammar and spelling makes you look like an amateur and causes the reader to think of this as your best, then the product must be just as bad or worse. Use grammarly.com and Hemingwayapp.com and other tools to perfect grammar and spelling.
- Always review your copy it’s not done until you have iterated 3 times, you will learn more after reviewing other people's copy, it is how you make sure your copy produces.
## What is Short Form Copy
And how to master it for good
- This is the beginning of your copywriting career
- Short form is the beginning of any kind of engagement with a brand or business, it’s to sell the click not the product
- Examples of this are newsletters, social media posts, tweets, social media ads
- The purpose of it is to give them a reason to leave their current platform for another like a landing page. Think, from a chaotic place to a controlled and catered environment, where there are less distractions like a Lambo showroom. You want to take them from the sidewalk to the showroom
- You need to understand not selling in the inbox, and in doing this you will sell much more.
- **You want to bring people to where they can get sold to.**
## DIC Framework
(Disrupt Intrigue Click)
High curiosity short form copy
- This framework is a series of steps and a foundation, it’s all about grabbing attention and getting them to click
- Steps: Disrupt > Intrigue > Click
- Disrupt: This is where you catch their attention, if there’s an image use a disrupting image because they will see this first, it needs to be different from their environment. Think pattern interrupt. It's also the first few lines of long-form copy. Instill some intrigue and curiosity, little bits.
- Intrigue: Amplify and stack the curiosity and intrigue until the reader can’t help but take action. Multiple fascinations, not-statements, creating unanswered questions, etc use all the tools to tease. When they get to the end they need to have low-grade anxiety, the splinter, for them to desire an answer. 
- Click: Simplistic is a single line with a CTA (call-to-action), now you simply direct them to take the action *“hey, you want the answer click here”*. A good CTA contains all 3 elements of the DIC, as most people will scan the email to the bottom. Be sure your CTA doesn’t reveal the *“answer”* to the secret you have been teasing, you want to keep the mystery alive.
- A Bonus can be a PS at the end of the email. For example, to drop even more intrigue on the reader or to amplify their pain or desire. 
- **DIC works well with cold traffic, people who don’t know anything about your brand and products**
- You can use this to get people to consume more content videos, blogs, podcasts, etc. 
- Recommends most short-form copy stay under 250 words
- The primary text is the intrigue
- Emojis are cool for disrupts in subject lines
- On IG the CTA is usually referenced to the link in the bio
- DIC is a format you will use A LOT as a copywriter
## PAS Framework
(Pain/Desire Amplify Solution)
Get them to move from the short-form copy...
- This framework is great for inspiring action and providing motivation especially once they have already discovered the answer. This magnifies the emotion to take action.
- Steps: pain/desire > amplify > solution
- Pain/Desire: You can use either one, dangle the carrot or whip with the stick. This is where you stop them for their attention and hit them with a great emotional experience by amplifying their greatest button pain or desire
- Amplify: Humans have many ways of self-soothing and minimizing the emotional intensity of our pain and desire because it’s easier than changing to fulfil the desire or fix the pain. 
	- To get them to take action you must stoke the flames of their existing pain or desire until it propels them to action
	- You do this with sensory experience you want them to play a movie in their mind to trigger a corresponding emotion. Sight smell taste sound and touch, you don’t have to use all, but the more you can the better and more vivid the movie. Use this sensory information that’s around that pain or desire
	- You do this with future pacing, you want to give a taste of what could happen if they don’t solve the problem by highlighting the reality of not taking the action. However, it’s better to go the positive route than the negative in most situations.
	- Show them how their pain or desire can connect to their higher need think Maslows you can amplify the compulsion to act.
	- You can show them how their situation or dream affects their status in the eyes of others to magnify the emotion
	- Take their desire and show them how it connects to their greatest wants and needs
- Solution: Direct them with a simple line to direct their action to resolve their heightened state of emotion. There are a few levers you can pull to enact this:
	- A reader believes there’s a limited time to take advantage of an opportunity, the pain/desire is amplified, you want to create urgency and play with time 
	- Scarcity, this is more about the availability and or quantity of the solution to solve the problem. A boat with 2 seats remaining with 20 people in line.
	- You can one last time crank on the dial of their emotions to push them over the edge.
- PSA is how you get people who have already experienced DIC to take another or the initial value exchange.
## HSO Framework
(Hook Story Offer)
Shift their brains with the power of story 
- This is all about shifting belief and inspiring desire and curiosity using the power of story
- 3 main sections: hook > story > offer
- Hook: Catching the attention and getting them to want to read the story, usually done with one strong fascination (a bribe to read)
- Story: Humans have evolved to change beliefs, make decisions, learn and absorb information through the power of story. Think of the hieroglyphs, books of scriptures, because stories guide people, shift beliefs and allow the reader to sympathetically experience the same emotions and transformations as the characters inside. Similar to when you are watching a movie and cry or feel an emotion. 
- All stories follow the hero’s journey
- The journey starts with describing the known world, then the call to adventure
- Important storytelling tips
	- Start the story at the height of drama at the moment when all seems to be lost, preview the drama, the scary, the wild. Think Bond movie trailers 
	- Ensure the main character means something to the reader, and some aspirational elements so the reader can identify with the character and see themselves as the character to become emotionally involved. The main character and the avatar need to match. We are able to relate to people who are like us. 
	- Skip parts of the story to create intrigue. Lead the reader up to the point of despair then fast forward to the point when they are living the dream. This creates an extreme information gap which creates curiosity that you can capitalize on in the next phase. 
	- Offer: Direct them to take action to calm their curiosity to fill in the information gap or direct them to follow the path of the character you have walked them through (the journey) so they can mimic it themselves. The CTA is similar to the others, DIC and PSA. 
	- **HSO is great way to get readers to experience the solution.**
## Short Form Copy Best Practices
Avoid the land mines and win
- Most short-form copy should be under 150 (250 max) words to force you to only use impactful words to keep the reader's attention and avoid mistakes, per email, FB ad, etc plus it’s about the most a read will likely take the time to consume.
- Mini skirt rule, Long enough to cover the important parts, but short enough to keep things interesting. 
- In copy, reviews ask, *"Does this add to the copy? Does this take away from the copy? Is this neutral?* This exercise keeps you in line with only what adds to the experience and end goal.
- Each piece of short-form copy should have only one idea or you begin to sound crazy and dilute your power and effectiveness. You want to bring all of your persuasive power to bare.
- The **thread**, your copy, should all comment one into another. Each line should make you want to read the next line. There are no gaps or friction, each line builds on the next. It needs to be fun and exciting you are competing with everything that can distract them, their dog, TikTok, IG, etc.
- Use normal fonts and keep the grammar and spelling on point, don’t use words like *"this"*, or *"it"*, be specific, always.
- Avoid long paragraphs you want to maintain 1-2 lines because on mobile it can turn to 8 which is uncomfortable for readers. Keep it to one complete idea in a paragraph, never split up an idea. 
- Use bold, italic, and underlines sparingly these are meant for emphasis and to draw attention. Too many and it loses the effect. Once or twice per short form copy.
- Emojis when appropriate, they add some emotional context, they were made to express emotional subtext.
- Avoid sales clichés, readers are highly in tune with these and trigger sales guards and they dismiss you. Keep it personal you are speaking to one person.
- Avoid overly formal language, make it feel like a conversation between two friends, make it personal communication, and remember whoever can show they care the most connects the most and wins. Have fun with your writing as the reader will pick up on this! And enjoy it too.
- Writing can be fun make it fun and make it fun for the reader

## How To Model Successful Copy
Congratulations you can now write any form of copy on the planet
- This will allow you to learn any form of copy as it changes constantly in marketing
- The form will always change but the psychology principles remains the same
- As long as you can identify successful copy you can model it. Know what it is that they are doing what’s the skeleton (the different sections of copy)
- Swipe files are great resources
- Ways to do this is to swap out elements from a piece of copy that’s good and works for others and adapt it to function for your avatar
- It’s always good to find successful pieces of copy to model from in your world
- Build your swipe file of webinars, click funnels, newsletters, etc
- Sign up to as many newsletters as possible as a swipe file resource but on a separate email address
- Search successful (high engagement likes, comments, shares) ads on social platforms, also if its long running and they have spent lots of money on it often that indicates a good and functional funnel
- Before you write a landing page after your research, go and look at what others are doing so you can be successful
## What are Opt-in Pages
Why are they important and how do you write them?
- The opt-in trade is to collect the users details and get permission to contact them it’s usually the first step on the brand ladder.
- Once you have their contact info you can communicate with them directly.
- There’s many many styles of opt-in pages and that’s fine because you know the elements to write for them which is typically a DIC framework with a dash of authority and trust comments mixed in.
- **Opt-in is also known as a landing page, it is best to position the voice as authoritative.**
- Success is measured by conversion rate and 25% is the bare minimum to have.
- Landing pages are so important as it’s often the beginning of the relationship with a user to be marketed to.
#### Opt-in Headers
- Your consistency with the headline your pages uses to whatever the hook/fascination is meant to keep them connected.
- The header is often a big promise to solve and provide something, this fascination needs to be potent and rock the readers brain, powerful! So good that they will speak to their fiends about it.
#### Opt-in Curiosity Bullets
- You want to build enough of the intrigue about what is on the other side of submitting their info, that they will be haunted if they never opt-in
- Fascinations are also called curiosity bullets
- Stacking curiosity bullets build intrigue and curiosity and each bullet is so good that the reader wants all of them
- Insert some authority and build trust which is highly important especially for those who are unfamiliar with you which is most people. Show your track record, name drop, etc you covered this earlier in the boot camp here (link it)
- Increasing authority gives them confidence in the big promise of the header
## Mission – Landing Page
Pick any product you'd like from [the swipe file](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/11bGJkOSOX6Z7jhkQja1hIGHK9iXeGrXS?usp=sharing)  and write one landing page for a hypothetical "free gift" (i.e. ebook) related to the product.
## How to Write Email Sequences
How to use email to ascend customers up the value ladder
- Email is an extremely important tool, so you can use the same principles to plan out various forms of content
- The lessons here can apply to social media platforms, sms, etc.
- A person signing up to a brands email is a person signing up to join the brands world
- If the brand can shift a subscribers beliefs and nurture that relationship they can move them up the value ladder and generate lots of sales, develop huge scale, sell lots of product and have fans for life
- Different kinds of email sequences: welcomes email which is the opt-in email
- This is their first step into the brand and you want to hyper build the value and build rapport
- You don’t have to make each email a CTA to the next product. This would be called a ==value email== where you teach them a small lesson or direct them to a media asset like YouTube video, podcast episode, content that will help shift their beliefs
- Ask yourself where the person is and where they want to go and craft the sequence, what we have here is just an outline. Even if they don’t buy a product you want to ensure they are bought into the brand, addicted like Pavalov Dogs expirement 
- To get good at *welcome emails* signup to as many as possible in your swipe file as well to study what they are doing
- Normal Email is about giving them value think like a bank account every email is a deposit of value. Still include the DIC, PAS, and HSO just instead link to some free stuff and a micro CTA 
	* Your ratio of email should be 3:1 (value:sales) 
	* This is your regular content (value driven) email 
#### Email Stages
This sequence is also called the indoctrination sequence and this is where you begin to reshape their understanding of the world and to prepare them to Purchase the next product off the next step in the brand ladder.
1. Email 1 is a simple introduction and the actual bait they signed up for, and you will tease them with valuable content to expect in the next email
2. Email 2 is usually an HSO email where they get the opportunity to know the guru/brand, discovery their story, and shift some beliefs, to build report
3. Email 3 a pure value email to give them knowledge on how to overcome upcoming roadblocks to get to their dream state, often done with a DIC format. You can also just present the answer up front 
4. Email 4 is another DIC directing them to the product it’s 100% focused on driving newly educated and excited readers to go to the sales page, stack a lot of curiosity 
5. Email 5 is usually a PAS style email to help them get over the edge and visit a sales page for the product you want to up sell . They are already excited so this email is to crank up the emotions. This is to sell the next product on the ladder.

### Launch sequence email 
- These are for the release of a new product, event, and service to get people aware
- There’s often an announcement email a few weeks before the product becomes available to encourage pre-orders 
- Then you want to give a lot of value emails to amplify the pain/desire, educate on the solutions being solved, all this information focused around the new product
- After all the value emails, closer to the launch date you want a series of PAS email, once the product is available for purchase to amplify pain and desire 
- If there’s a sales period or time limit access there’s usually some high urgency PAS style email that go out at different  times letting the reader know they have 48 hour. "25 hour left etc. especially just before the final hours to close"
- Many businesses run several launches 🚀 in a cyclical pattern like every holiday for example 

### Reactivation Sequence
Overtime people will stop opening your email, so you don’t want to send emails to people who do not open it as email services track this and may move you to junk. With these customers you either want to reinstate them or cut them out.

**Steps Overview:** 
1. segment out the subscribers who have opened in x months
2. then send them a series letting them know they will be removed soon, you can bring them back in with a free offer. "click here if you want to stay” . You bribe them with discounts as well or a re-indoctrination with content similar to the welcome email. These email you to use high intrigue and curiosity building and heighten attention grabbing headers. You want them back into the brand 
3. Eventually there will be a breakup email . After that you filter them out your list to keep your quantity of open rate, high.

### Segmentation
- Modern email marketing software (EMS) is like Mailchimp, Active Campaign, etc
- These software allow you to segment email based on behaviour of the customers
- Allowing you to tag and filter ensures you can provide the most value to each group like men vs women
- ROI rule is you should earn $1/month for each subscriber 
- If you show up and a biz has 100k subs but only earner 20$k then you know you need to improve their email sequence and/or add new products to get more value per contact 
- Segmentation provides better experience 
## Mission – Email Sequences
Take the landing page you wrote for you last mission,  
  
And write a welcome email sequence (3-5 emails) driving readers to purchase the associated product.
## What is long form copy
- long form copy refers to VSL landing pages, copy webinars sales pages, 
- long form content that can take someone from where they are to a conversion 
- Writing long form is using all the skills from short form in combinations
- Long form is more valuable to business than short for as it’s responsible for conversions get people to pull out their wallet for example

## Long Form Copy Outline
- This is a live review of the following content: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1VKUAL59y5491frP-ywfOC6po4Yn7jjsumvM58UrhsQM/edit?usp=sharing
- this is a loose outline and the sections change based on needs
- All sales pages shift beliefs, help reader to buy product, teach new lessons
- The elements discussed are found  in most if not all long form pages. Elements being headline, lead, body, close
#### Headline: 
- grab attention to have them think about it all day long, build massive curiosity, it’s about the reader, headlines make or break 
#### Lead: 
- It’s similar to PAS and or das, you make big promise, revealing the pain, tease the solution to dream state, and create great openings 
- Consumption of your sales page depends on how good your headline is and the lead: 
- Connecting to their pain, making big promise, teasing certain things that will be reviewed in the rest of the page, establishing credibility, so they want something, they’re curious about something, and it’s just safe and real enough for them  continue on
#### Body: 
- the whole point is to red pill them on how the world really works, bring them the reality of the world.
- Shift their beliefs, to show them how they what they need to do to get the dream state ut not how
- There's usually a discovery story, taking the reader on the journey of discovery that the Guru took, its a story on how the guru found the solution
- This is to show them the reader how the too can achieve the same result
- Start with the height of drama to open the loop
- Then show the Gurus struggles and be sure not to make the Guru look like a loser, you want him to look like a good guy who just had a problem because of a lack of  understanding/knowledge or misbelief, keep it to something simple that our solution easily solves
- ie. "he was a good guy who worked hard and just didn't understand how to make use of credit"
- You want to give the reader a chance to empathize with the Guru, so they can relate and see he's gone through the same as them
- The user should read the body, and end up with a ton of cuestions and a shited mindset, easger to impliment what the solution in the body
#### Close:
- Introduce the product and help them make their purchase decision by staking new beliefs, you want 
- Position the product or service as the vehicle for them to act on and impliment the solution you have provided
- After you tease the product you want to add a few testimonials
- Create massive FOMO you want to tease the actual product without giving the product, use lots of fascination bullet points
- Hit them hard in the feels to push them over the edge so that they make the decision
- Hit them up with value stacking, what's in the product then introduce the price
- Stack additional value with bonus to give the reader a sense of added benefit on top of the product, the extras
- Lay down in forms of gaurantee and risk reversals
- End off with the 3 way close
- This can be structured in many ways for a sales page, the key is to have all of the elements in place
