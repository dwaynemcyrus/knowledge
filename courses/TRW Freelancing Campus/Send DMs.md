## Notes
### Why Fiverr and Upwork Are For Brokies
- These platforms attract people are looking for quick cheap work
- You are competing on a platform that is based strictly on lowest price
- Instead build your own universe where people come to you to pay medium to high ticket
### My Opinion On Cold Email
- It works but it goes against the teachers method
- You only need 3-4 clients to live abroad which equates to 3-4 grand
- Freelancing is about building long-term relationships with your clients
- If you do use cold email, pay someone to do it for you, it’s best for you to build your skill, learn your market, showcasing your value, etc.
- The aim is to have 2-3 clients you are working with monthly to make them more successful
### How to Build Rapport Quickly
- The quickest way is to lead with value by offering a gift, the free value
- If you wanted to be a Twitter Ghostwriter you can offer someone 20 free tweets in their voice
- Testimonials give great social proof
- The prospects only care about how you can make them more money or get them more engagement 
- Messaging in the DMs are far more personal
- The offer script, “I have written you 3 free emails in their voice, I write email for clients and want you to see what I can do to increase your open rate, please try them out and let me know what results you get”
- If they get tangible results but are not hiring they are more likely to hire you
- Do not connect with low quality people, you want high quality who have money
### 6 Figure DM Template
- Best used on Twitter, Instagram, and LinkedIn
- Do not copy the template directly
- This DM requires you to have already built up some rapport through comments, follows, etc
- If a prospect isn’t interested always ask for the referral
- Too many freelancers become too salesy instead of focusing on simply solving a problem
- This is a numbers game and you need to focus on the niches you are already into and running the numbers
#### The Script Structure
1. Compliment them something specific such as a recent thread they did, it must be genuine and specific and personal from you
2. Ask a question that sets the stage for qualifying them for your service. You can ask are you using these threads for your emails 
3. Lead the convo through a few more questions to telling them you have ideas for them & that you can tell them over the phone. Other questions can be about the amount of emails they send and what the experience has been like. 
### The Perfect Script
- There is no perfect script ever! 
- You are always one DM away from a client
- When you reach out, you need to be benefit oriented, focus on how you will make them more money or engagement instead of what you are going to do such as setting up flows, tags, etc
- Always make it clear how you are going to benefit them upfront, “I have made this much for a client I want to do the same for you” or “Here’s what I have made a client in $ these past 7 days” with a screenshot and a link for them to book a call
- The words and features DO NOT matter, because they do not care and in many cases don’t know
- You only need 2-3 clients at a premium price to get the freedom you need
- With cold email you are trying to sell them on the call to learn more
- Throw the idea of the perfect script out the window, you just need to test, test, test, this is the [[OODA Loop]]
### How to Gain Instant Credibility 
- Setup a proper bio on Twitter, Instagram, or LinkedIn is the quickest and easiest way
- Make videos such as “benefits of a welcome email sequence” 
- Leverage results you have gained for yourself and/or others
- Testimonials and social proof are big
### Understand Your Market
- To begin with you won’t know but you can figure it out by reading through comments and social profiles
- Problems are what you need to identify: great threads, but when I signup for email there’s not much going on // they are selling products but their email doesn’t do a good job selling
- Start by being engaged in the environment of social media of your skill and niche it’s a great place to identify issues and solutions
### Can I DM a Lead Multiple Times?
- Yes, DMing just once is a loss
- It’s the persistent people who get what they want
- Did you make sure the people you are contacting are who you need to talk to?
- 2nd: Always following up “I’m just checking in as I know you are busy and I want to be sure my ideas get bumped up the list in your DM”
- 3rd: I have a few clients I am working with now, and really want to get you in if possible, but if this doesn’t appeal for you right now, no problem. This is the final. 
###  What If Someone’s DMs Are Off?
- Go check their other social media profiles and DM their
- If no social media access, then go to their website for an email
- If no social, no email, then move on from this client it’s a waste of time 
### Red Flags to Avoid
- People with large accounts with little engagement 
- People who are trying to lowball you, you are not in the business of saving people, you want to make them more money
- People who ghost you for 3 days to a week
- People who are highly emotional and highly anxious, this includes yourself Don’t Be emotional about your business
### Retainer vs. Performance Based
- Always searching for the next client is not a good model
- Retainer first (3 emails each week per month for $1000)
- Performance second (whenever a sale is generated based on the work you get 10-15%)
- Once you have secured retainer clients for a few months with proof of concept, you then can move into performance pay
- A way to track the performance is to use an affiliate link and you explain it by educating them on how transparent this method is and that you only get paid on the results you produce
### Send DMs Daily
- You need to get into the habit of seeking out people
- Stop theorizing whether something will or won’t work, start your focus on 5 DMs a day
- The process: introduce yourself, give them some tips, offer to write 2-3 free emails
### Problem Prospecting
- You must pick your niche and dig into a sub niche (mental health coach > holistic? > ? / relationship coach > helping women > ?)
### How to Find Clients on Twitter and Instagram
- Start with reaching out to the leaders/authority of your niche 
- Go to their profile and check who they follow, as these are people who they deem as valuable 
- On Twitter look for the 10-30k range of followers
- Always end the first DM with a question related to what you are offering
### How to Find Clients on Instagram, Twitter, LinkedIn
- You want to start with making a social media profile, the aim is to leverage social media so you chase less
- Don’t have examples? Use other people’s work to create proof of concepts as samples. Put together your own portfolio. 
- Next you will begin to put out content 
- Twitter is for the person who enjoys writing, and it’s a great place to network in some cases better than LinkedIn
- Jim people’s email lists and see how you can improve their emails. 
- On Instagram use hashtags for your niches to begin filtering people, more on this will be found in a later module 
- LinkedIn is a great place to reach out to local and offline business which is less about personal brand businesses
- To build the profile on LinkedIn begin to post content
- The aim here is to leverage social media as it put you directly in front of potential clients
