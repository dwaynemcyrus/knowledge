### The Direction
*"O Allah! I seek goodness from Your Knowledge and with Your Power (and Might) I seek strength, and I ask from You Your Great Blessings, because You have the Power and I do not have the power. You Know everything and I do not know, and You have knowledge of the unseen. Oh Allah! If in Your Knowledge this action…*

**of speaking for the people, my people, the “blacks” and the believers, the Muslims publicly online**

*...is better for my religion and faith, for my life and end death, for here in this world and the hereafter then make it destined for me and make it easy for me and then add blessings baraka' in it, for me. O Allah! In Your Knowledge if this action is bad for me, bad for my religion and faith, for my life and end death, for here in this world and the hereafter then turn it away from me and turn me away from it and whatever is better for me, ordain destine that for me and then make me satisfied with it."*
### The Response
**The Cave**  
18:51 Assistants…what does this mean…to guide people wrongly…is this a warning? 
18:50-52 Is this a warning or a reassurance because I have no desire to mislead anyone… help me please.

**The Ant**  
27:9 Yes, it is you. Yes, it is the prophet you mention most often to me, I’m afraid. 
27:8-10 Ya Rabb, am I to be a messenger? Yes, I am afraid of being a voice. Charles even told me when I speak I am devastating.

**The Victory**  
48:4 This feeling you have and the peace you seek in your heart is from Allah SWT. I believe I weep, because I know what I must do, and I fear the doing of it. 
48:3-5 Do not be afraid you are a soldier of Allah SWT and your weapon is your voice. Use it for victory in this life. Oh, Allah SWT this terrifies me deeply! 
### The Reflection

### The Understanding
Is my staying in my own cave…my hiding going to lead me to darkness? It already does. So I must start, and though I am small my deeds will grow big. Ultimately victory is in the hands of Allah SWT as long as I do the work and SPEAK.
