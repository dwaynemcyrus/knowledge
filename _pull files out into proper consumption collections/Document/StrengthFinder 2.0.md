    -   Focus
        
        People exceptionally talented in the Focus theme can take a direction, follow through and make the corrections necessary to stay on track. They prioritize, then act.
        
        ### What Is the Definition of Focus?
        
        "Where am I headed?" you ask yourself. You ask this question every day. Guided by this theme of Focus, you need a clear destination. Lacking one, your life and your work can quickly become frustrating. And so each year, each month, and even each week, you set goals. These goals then serve as your compass, helping you determine priorities and make the necessary corrections to get back on course.
        
        Your Focus is powerful because it forces you to filter; you instinctively evaluate whether or not a particular action will help you move toward your goal. Those that don't are ignored. In the end, then, your Focus forces you to be efficient. Naturally, the flip side of this is that it causes you to become impatient with delays, obstacles, and even tangents, no matter how intriguing they appear to be. This makes you an extremely valuable team member.
        
        When others start to wander down other avenues, you bring them back to the main road. Your Focus reminds everyone that if something is not helping you move toward your destination, then it is not important. And if it is not important, then it is not worth your time. You keep everyone on point.
        
        ### How to Better Understand Your Focus Theme
        
        **How people with strong Focus talents describe themselves:**
        
        -   "I am deeply driven and single-minded."
        -   "I need a goal to establish priorities."
        -   "I love to begin with the end in mind."
        -   "I hate going off on misdirected tangents."
        -   "I bring clarity through concentration and direction."
        
        ### How to Apply Your Focus to Succeed
        
        **Work With Focus:** You function best when you can concentrate on a few well-defined initiatives and demands. Give yourself permission to reject projects or tasks that do not align with your overall mission. This will help you concentrate your efforts on your most important priorities -- and will help others appreciate your need for focus.
        
        **Lead With Focus:** Your greatest worth as a team member might be helping others set goals. At the end of meetings, take responsibility for summarizing what was decided, for defining when these decisions will be acted on, and for setting a date when the group will reconvene.
        
        **Live With Focus:** When you set goals, discipline yourself to include timelines and measurements. These will provide regular proof that you are indeed making progress.

    -   Self-Assurance
        
        People exceptionally talented in the Self-Assurance theme feel confident in their ability to take risks and manage their own lives. They have an inner compass that gives them certainty in their decisions.
        
        ### What Is the Definition of Self-Assurance?
        
        Self-Assurance is similar to self-confidence. In the deepest part of you, you have faith in your strengths. You know that you are able -- able to take risks, able to meet new challenges, able to stake claims, and, most important, able to deliver. But Self-Assurance is more than just self-confidence.
        
        Blessed with the theme of Self-Assurance, you have confidence not only in your abilities but in your judgment. When you look at the world, you know that your perspective is unique and distinct. And because no one sees exactly what you see, you know that no one can make your decisions for you.
        
        No one can tell you what to think. They can guide. They can suggest. But you alone have the authority to form conclusions, make decisions, and act. This authority, this final accountability for the living of your life, does not intimidate you. On the contrary, it feels natural to you.
        
        No matter what the situation, you seem to know what the right decision is. This theme lends you an aura of certainty. Unlike many, you are not easily swayed by someone else's arguments, no matter how persuasive they may be. This Self-Assurance may be quiet or loud, depending on your other themes, but it is solid. It is strong. Like the keel of a ship, it withstands many different pressures and keeps you on your course.
        
        ### How to Better Understand Your Self-Assurance Theme
        
        **How people with strong Self-Assurance talents describe themselves:**
        
        -   "I am confident on the inside when there is doubt all around me."
        -   "I need freedom to act unilaterally and independently."
        -   "I love being in control of my own destiny."
        -   "I hate others telling me what to do."
        -   "I bring a willingness to take necessary risks."
        
        ### How to Apply Your Self-Assurance to Succeed
        
        **Work With Self-Assurance:** Your exceptionally hard work and long hours are natural products of the passion and confidence you feel about your work. Don't assume that others are similarly wired.
        
        **Lead With Self-Assurance:** You don't have a great need for direction and support from others. This could make you particularly effective in situations that require independent thinking and action. Recognize and actively contribute the value of your Self-Assurance talents when confidence and self-control are crucial.
        
        **Live With Self-Assurance:** Set ambitious goals. Don't hesitate to reach for what others see as impractical and impossible, but what you see as merely bold and exciting -- and most importantly -- achievable with some heroics and a little luck. Your Self-Assurance talents can lead to achievements that you may not have otherwise even imagined.
