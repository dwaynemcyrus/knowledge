### Lesson
Today we have…
- a story from a woman considering breaking up with the perfect boyfriend
- and of course our lesson exploring the fundamental differences between men and women

#### Overview
Before we jump into who men are we need to get on the same page about men and women being different, otherwise nothing else I tell you will be effective.
#### Core Points
- There's a difference between sex and gender
	- Sex is biology, females have ovaries and produce eggs, males have testes and produce sperm with females have XX chromosomes and males have XY chromosomes
	- Gender until recent has typically been split between girl/boy, man/woman and has associated personality traits, appearances, and behaviours which fall under masculinity and femininity
	- Masculinity encompasses 
- How we process information...
	- Problem solving: 
		- Men tend to converge in their thinking. They define and clarify the problem and begin by eliminating and isolating issues.
		- Women will often define the problem in broader terms and allow a wider array of potential factors before going into solution mode.
		- This is why women want to talk out problems and men want to dive right into solving them.
	- Feelings and logic...
		- Men take a more fact-based approach to their environment, often scanning for threats and challenges.
		- Women tend to take a more intuitive approach because they perceive people and events more deeply and with greater memory capacity.
		- In short men process information through logic first where women process information through emotion first
	- Dealing with conflict
		- Men tend to depersonalize and externalize issues or problems giving them time to think through solutions, often in solitude.
		- Women tend to personalize and are more inclined to want to talk through the issue to reach understanding.
- Our perspectives in life
	- A woman’s perspective tends to be more inwardly directed. 
		- **“Confidently enticing**.**”** Unlike the male, who must go out into the world to find his destiny, the woman possesses her future within herself. She has a hidden but deep confidence in this.
		- **Values intimacy above action**. A woman cares more about _being_ than _doing_, and she finds the reason for her being in _relationship_.
		- **Wisely (selectively) receptive**. Though she values relationships above all else, a woman does not enter into them indiscriminately. She chooses slowly and receives wisely.
		- **Seeks security**. Because her orientation is _inward_, toward relationships, nurturing, and “nesting,” the female of the species puts a premium on safety and security. To a far greater extent than the male, she values qualities like “dependability” and “trustworthiness” in a potential mate.
		- **Prefers modesty**. A confident woman knows that she possesses something very precious and valuable – the power of her femininity – and she is driven by an innate desire to protect it. Modesty is fundamental to her nature.
		- **Caring**. The female is more naturally inclined to respond to the distressed, the needy, or the hurting with immediate compassion and care.
		- **Uses words**. Men talk to communicate information or ideas. Women talk to communicate feelings and thoughts. As a result, women tend to use more words than men.
		- **Desires equity** _and_ **submission**. A woman wants to be a man’s equal, but an equal of a very special kind. At a deep and fundamental level she has a strong desire to be led, protected, and cared for.
		- **Wields “soft power” which shapes humanity**. Women have the ability to wield great and subtle influence in marriage and domestic relationships.
		- **Connecting**. The female is wired to _connect_ with others on many different levels.
	- ### A male’s orientation toward life tends to be outward. 
		- **Explorative**. Every boy and every man is on a _quest_. He discovers his identity “out there” in the world where he senses his larger purpose and destiny lie.
		- **Determined to “deliver the goods**.” A man places great stock in knowing that he has what it takes to complete the quest and accomplish the task at hand.
		- **Needs to know what’s next**. Unlike a woman, he isn’t inclined to “cuddle,” to “savor” meaningful experiences, or to “linger” in the moment. Generally speaking, he’s anxious to move on to the next thing.
		- **Opportunistic**. To put it another way, the male is a _doer_; and in the final analysis, his feelings about what he’s doing or his reasons for doing it are less important to him than the urge and the opportunity to get it done.
		- **Takes chances**. To seize and make the most of his opportunities, a boy or a man must be willing to take chances. Accordingly, a propensity to run a certain degree of risk is fundamental to the male character.
		- **Initiator**. All of this presumes a certain willingness and ability to “take the bull by the horns” and make things happen. It also suggests that leadership, while not necessarily an exclusively male prerogative, is nevertheless more deeply rooted in the nature of men and boys.
		- **Active and aggressive**. There’s an obvious connection between initiation and active aggression. In light of this, it’s interesting to note that the male brain is two-and-a-half times larger and more vital in the center devoted to aggression and action than the female brain.
		- **Competitive and dominant**. Men want the best and will expend incredible energy toward getting it.
#### Summary
This information should give you a good understanding on what makes men different from you as a women. With this foundation we begin down our journey into who men are, how we think, and [[TDP Episode 002 What Men Look For|what we look for in women]] which is where we will begin in the next episode.

### Story
*“Alright ladies grab your favourite drink, snacks, and get comfortable it’s story time."*

Takeaways
- It is good that you are aware of you mental health and by your account he understanding and supportive of this
- "Still his" means that you are loyal to him, he has committed himself to you, and you have not
- He's become a second option, chances are you have been exposed to other men and getting their attention and are intrigued by the possibility of doing better
- Yes you are being selfish, and you do know what to do, you are just looking for a means of ending it while taking minimal accountability and consequences
- You are best to leave this man alone, and DO NOT return once you end it, it will be a mercy killing, and he is better off with a women who truly want him as a first choice
