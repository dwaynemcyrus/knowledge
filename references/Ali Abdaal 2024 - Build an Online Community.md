As the community business blows up people will join a bunch then get overwhelmed and burnt out and reduce down to one or two. How do you set yourself up to be the one or two surviving communities that people can’t imagine not being apart of.

@1200-1400
Reason people want an online community 
- It’s not about the content.
- For much of human existence we have lived in small communities and nowadays must people in our modern culture are alone doing their own things why is a big gap to fill in providing a community 
- We need connection to people it’s what we crave and currently social media is the closest thing to it outside of actual people second to that we crave transformation point a-b 
- People want a sense of identity something recognize with because most people don’t know themselves, they want to understand who they are.
- Content facilitates transformation 
- The stickiness of a community is the connection
