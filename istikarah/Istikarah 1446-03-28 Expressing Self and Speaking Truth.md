## The Direction
Is speaking the truth my way forward? I mean back to speaking on how men need to be, our trauma, our healing, our relationship to self and others like I did on TikTok. While also educating the women on who we are as men.

  

I’m going to return to what worked on TikTok and speak the truth about righteous men to men and women.

  

The Guidance 

First: Defrauding 

83:27 Mixture? Talking to men and including women? I don’t understand this.

  

83:24-30 Dang. Okay so my work was and can return to being blessed work. It was always blessed work, I simply never made it possible for myself to receive the provision from Allah SWT for it. People did mock me for doing what I did on TikTok and I lost my account too. 

  

This really was Gods work you were doing. You were really on Haqq. 

  

Ya Rabb and m scared to build my army of men.

  

Second: The Light

24:61 Constraint. That being there’s no limit in asking for what I need from my family and friends. 

  

You need to make friends.

  

24:58-64 Speak to your people. Make boundaries for yourself, your wife, and children. Allah is giving you correction for your home. But most importantly it’s guidance for you! 

  

Be like the messenger and call the people.

  

Third: The Prophets

21:59 Gods…there’s only one. How does this apply to my work? 

  

Oh snap, you said there’s only 2 groups of people. Those with God and those against. Be the guy holding the flashlight.

  

21:56-62 You forgot you are a soldier for Allah SWT the righteous people. A messenger. A voice in all th confusion. The example. The leader.

  

Your enemy are the idol worshippers the one leading against the oneness of God. 

  

Satan is an open enemy to you.

  

Ya Rab, I don’t want to fight, not anymore, not again.

  

## The Reflection
There’s a verse on fighting [[2:216]].

I have to fight. Sigh…I wanted peace. Wow! You realize your tagline says, “Inner Battle for Outer Peace”. 

You born fighting for life. You are still fighting to live. The world is at war. You know this. Yet, you turn your eye, shut them close. 

Going against Allah SWT commands for you, you specifically, putting yourself in position to be defrauded. It’s time to gather your people. It’s time to gather your sword — the pen. 

I want to be soft, love soft, be the gentle guy. The signs tell you otherwise and you know this.
