## Notes
### How to Setup Streak
The key to have no errors is to ensure that your only service that you are signed into is a the exact email address in all applications, Streak, Google Drive, Google Sheets, Gmail, etc.
1.  Always make use of your Chrome browser with the email account that you are using with [[Streak CRM]]
2. Install the Streak extension and along with the Streak CRM Importer extension
3. Refresh the browser and sign-in to the Streak app from Gmail (Import data: No/Recommended: Person)
4. Be sure to go through Streak University to learn how to use the software, it's a great resources
5. Add the "Product" and "Compliment" columns as customs, using "free form" from the drop down
6. Import your data from Google Sheets, you may need to refresh the page to have Streak show up under the extension tab
7. Map the column titles with the variables and ensure everything shows up, keep "ignore header row" checked

### How to Send Emails with Streak
- Once your prospects are all in you can make use of "mail merge", this allows you to use variables
- The variables make use of the fields from your Sales Pipeline
- As you have send out emails be sure to move the contacts to the next section of the Sales Pipeline

### Followup
- Reasons they have not replied
	- They are just busy
	- They don't like your stuff
	- They are not in the buying window
- Do not hound your prospects, there's billions of businesses in the world who need you, remember you need to keep a good reputation
- If someone's response back is argumentative and/or irritated just say thank you and remove them from the list, remember the goals is 3-4 clients to get you to $12K/month minimum
#### 1st Follow Up
- If there's no response within 24-48 hours, send a quick follow up, just not that you wanted to resurface the email incase it got buried and lost
#### 2nd Follow Up
- Drop a little more curiosity and tease them again with some more value/information, and consider asking them a question in that email
- Send this message out a week later

#### 3rd Follow Up
- This is to check if they are interested or not, just so you know not to harass them further and to remove from the list if need be
#### Quarterly Monthly Follow Up
- There's been no response so place them in a special area to be reached out to in the next 3 months
- On the follow up you will need to use a different outreach method, as they may be closer to being in a buying open

### How to Setup the Call when they Reply
- If they reply back in any negative way wish them a nice day and move on. The goal is to be collaborative not combative, do not waste time convincing.
- They respond wanting a call, you want to get a time set up within the next 2-3 days that is within your Google calendar
- Get yourself a free [[Zoom]] account this how you will set this all up
- They may ask you some specific questions like your experience, etc. This CANNOT be done via email. 
- If they ask about what you charge you tell them that your pricing is based on the need of each client, while teasing some more of your ideas
- If they do not want to move forward with a call until you answer the question, politely tell them that's not how you do business and end the process there. Again, do not waste time.
- Sending a [[Calendly]] link tends to not work best. It's better to go back and forth securing a time and sending the confirmation that way.

### Reach out to your Own Network
- Think of all of the people you may know who are running a business online and offer them free value to get your first client and build a quick profile
- Think really hard about this list, of people you have worked with in the past as well and reach out, DO NOT ignore your own network
- Do this personal reach out before the external reach out tactics from this course

## Homework
1. Import your 40 prospects into your Streak CRM  
2. Test 4 different subject lines by sending 4 batches of ten emails, each with a different subject line. 
3. 24 hours later, measure your open rate. If one has 80% or greater open rates, you have a winning subject line. If not test 4 new subject lines with 40 new prospects until you find one with 80% open rates  
4. Once you have 80% open rates from a single subject line, begin testing different variations to your email body message each day until you have 10% or higher positive reply rate.
