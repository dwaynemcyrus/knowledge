My problem with my life right now and myself is a lack of discipline. Well, that is what I have been telling myself and it’s not true. What is true is my lack of prioritization which in turn disrupts my ability to focus.

This is reminiscent of the conversation that I had with the Kolbe A debriefing. Alright, now how do we give ourselves a solution? 

I will define my visions and my goals with great clarity, then we will setup the plans to get there breaking it down simply.
