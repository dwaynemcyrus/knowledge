## How to Review and Breakdown Copy for Maximum Selfish Benefit
The purpose is to learn how to analyze copy so that you can analyze the copy of others.

Your ability to breakdown copy depends on the quality of questions that you ask yourself:
1. What is the objective of this piece of copy? Break it down into its smallest parts.
2. What is the writer doing to accomplish this objective? Why does it work? How could they do it better?
3. What mistakes is the writer making that is keeping them from achieving their objective? How could they fix these mistakes? How can I keep from making these mistakes myself?

The above 3 questions are the core and necessary questions to ask.

Asking yourself question number 4 while reviewing will give you more insight into answering the core 3 questions. 

Always think like a teacher when reviewing, don’t just identify the problem
