I am on the phone right now, and I do not care to be on the phone. Why in the world do I allow this nonsense to happen. It's because you have grown up people pleasing and putting others before yourself.

Clearly, a trait that you need to remove from yourself like a cancer.

This is necessary, very, very, very necessary. So, practice this here and now. Also, I really do not care at all for things that are not within my interest, more specifically I don't think I care much for people as a whole when it interferes with my time with myself.
