**stikarah**

How do I kill this version of me?it’s killing me!

  

Open: 41:3 READ THE QURAN!! Finish you blind reading my brother! 

102:4 Return to it properly so you may learn. 

(Entire Surah) Damn this is truth I am caught up in the worldly things, deeply I keep thinking of other and not me and the work. I’m worried about other, foolishly and yes it has me in a gel with myself. Add this to your reading for Dhuhr 

  

6:38 TRUST in Allah! There’s a reason you have this community that Allah has given you, you have been entrusted to serve this community and to care for it, to expand on it their knowledge and understanding. 

  

84:24 Speak up! Speak the truth, say what is real and do not hide it or make it less than. (23-25) Do right by your community you said you would use the Discord, so use it and read Qur’an with them starting today! Do it!

What’s next to do now? Well… there’s working out, studying, and training. This is true, so choose and do. 

  

I almost went towards the computer to put on “background video” see how quickly one can forget! However I did not I remembered I am fasting until 16k.

  

06:30 editing my first YouTube video in forever. 

  

18:41

…fell asleep at some point after finishing the title animation and now I’m up and a bit upset with myself for missing the time in which I wanted to do my Quran reading. 

  

Now, I need to reset and “catch up” to the rest of the day *sigh*. 

  

Gratitude. Gratitude. Gratitude.
