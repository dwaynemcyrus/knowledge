## Vision
A digital garden built for reflection and recall.  
The Knowledge Hub transforms static Markdown files into a semantic, interconnected landscape.

## Core Features
- Parses local Markdown notes into a searchable interface.  
- Graph view connecting notes by tag, topic, and similarity.  
- Local AI embeddings to suggest hidden connections.  
- Optional sync with Obsidian vaults.

## Technical Highlights
- Uses **Astro Content Collections** with MDX rendering.  
- Graph view via **D3.js** or **Vis.js**.  
- Local embeddings generated with **sentence-transformers** or **MLX**.  
- All processing occurs client-side for privacy.
