- Social media is a skill
- You need to create an offer ladder of valuable products and services to pull in an income doing what you enjoy
- You need digital leverage…having a lot of followers allow you to make money good money in 24 hours
- Your brand as a creator is based on what you want out of life, the thing you are leading your followers toward
- All burning problems exist in the eternal markets (love, money, health) and an additional one would be happiness
- Your brand needs to be a monopoly and you do that by being you and the way to do it is to: improve yourself, solve your own problems, master your survival, document your journey, pursue your curiosity and separate from the crowd
- Your story is your brand, story’s are what sell, all marketers know this
- Marketing and sales is showing so one that they can transform, people value the story that is your life and your challenges that you have overcome. Put your story out online and give valuable information along the way to have your own (mental) monopoly 
- The business is to improve yourself, help others improve themselves from your experiences, and both you and them will benefit as business as your vessel
- *“Build distribution, then build whatever you want”* - Jocko Wilick
- 3 types of distribution: built, borrowed, bought to build your audience, then deplatform them! Built is the most important, borrowed is someone mentioning you or retweeting you
- Mental monopoly is consistently putting out good ideas that stick in someone’s head, the remember your work
- Obviously paying people to mention you and or your work

- Growth is done with short form content where you get shares, it’s building distribution. It’s also where you transfer the audience to the authenticity areas.
- Authenticity is long form and takes longer to grow, it’s about talking more and using more of your language.
- Authority is a product that allows others to buy from you, to invest in you and gain a valuable exchange
- The most valuable people are those who can leverage their mind (knowledge and creativity)
- You must have a product to leverage while you grow so that you free up your time, productize! 
- The more people you help the more leverage you have best examples are authors.
- Internet content is not about most follow, engagement, attention it’s about valuable ideas, that equal relevant, understandable, and actionable ideas to the point that they are spread without effort
- The more perspective shifting ideas that you put out into the world the more mental  real estate of the connective physique you will occupy
![[quote - internet content is.jpeg]]
- You want to put an idea onto the masses that is not thought of
- **A good tweet that went viral is a great start to long form content**
![[quote - high performing YouTube.jpeg]]
- Start with high performing topics, steal my guy, steal! 
- As a creator you need to put in the reps and develop yourself through stages of growth.
- Stage 1 Low level creators, those who typically have no business experience. You have to start by posting high performing content you need to learn this. Study high performing content, emulate these people. Use social media templates as your training wheels. You must prioritize short form content (top level of the funnel distribution).
- A growth strategy is about getting people to share.
- Filter YouTube videos by top performers 
- Stage 2 This is where the growth begins and where the money really starts to hit.
![[quote - at 500 followers.jpeg]]
- The above is a good baseline to reference what is possible in this business model.
- First thing to do is to learn direct response marketing.
- At 10k you should have the growth game together
- Justin Welsh used the book cashvertising 
- Next build a high ticket sales offer as 10k is not enough for a low ticket offer you are better offer creating a coaching/consulting/freelancing service that you can work your way up to $2.5-5k and stacking skills applying them to a specific problem for a specific person
- the minimum viable offer video that is to sell something for 500-1000$
- Between stage 2-3 you should really have 4 clients paying $2500 a month to hit your 10k income goal through outreach and direct response marketing
- Last thing in stage 2 is to make long form content in a newsletter, podcast, YouTube. With a newsletter you move them up the awareness ladder where you don’t need to retarget them over and over again
- Getting trapped in stage 2 10-30k followers means you make a new 9-5 for yourself where you are still reaching out to clients and just continue to build an audience to gain more and new clients
- Stage 3, the high level creator (most don’t reach this) as its impossible to reach without survival mastery, ego development, multidisciplinary study, getting stuck in the one thing/niche thinking instead adding complimentary differences to stand out like spirituality 
- First thing to do productize, build a network, and leverage the results from your high ticket service and have iterated it to the point that it produces results consistently and reposition it (new product) for a broader audience where it doesn’t take up more of your time and instead frees up your time
![[quote - take your system and.jpeg]]
- Networking, which you should have always been doing, now you can DM 100k follower creators and offer to help each other grow on new platforms 
- Next is to refine your ideas and diversify
![[diagram - leverage growth authority authenticity.jpeg]]
- In stage 1 80% of your content needs to focus on growth, stage 2 is about authority, authenticity, and depth based content (YouTube, Podcasts, etc), stage 3 double down on your best ideas to diversify your audience on other platforms
![[quote - showing them I had value.jpeg]]
- Social capital is very important, much more important than money..
- The third thing you do is prioritize long form content once you have the high count in followers and money, position yourself as the sythesizer and gain mental monopoly, this is where it becomes super important for your brand so you do not become a commodity as people will be coping you left and right
![[quote - Note patterns based on your experience.jpeg]]
- When you read a book what are the big 5 ideas from it 
- Example the Eisenhower matrix, you can make your own as it’s just a valuable idea with a name that stuck with people like a positive mind virus
![[quote - take pieces of the long form.jpeg]]
- Apply your interests to your expertise, a few things that keep you from being a specialist
![[quote - as to methods there may be.jpeg]]
- Have a method of doing things, question everything, and test constantly
- “Never stop learning. Never stop building. Never stop. Never stop evolving.” Comfort and distraction are the only things that can get in your way, DO NOT GET STUCK in any area
- “Self-actualitize > self-monetize > self-transcend.”
