As survivors, our minds can easily and often become our jailers. Many of us have been living in a cell of our own creation for years.

I am no different.

My mind has become my cage for many years and it has dictated my actions in the world. It has been horrific because I have become increasingly hyper-conscience and self-aware.

Having taken on the life of a *“lone wolf”*, I have made the emotional burdens of others close to me, mine to bear. These burdens have become the chains and bars which I have used to create the prison of my mind.

Now here’s the hard truth I had to accept this past week.

**You do not need anyone’s permission or acknowledgment to let go of their emotional burdens.**

Permission was never asked of me to take on this emotional weight. Be it your mother, father, spouse, or siblings. So why in the world do I need their permission or acknowledgment to now reject these burdens?

Think about it.

You and I have the key to the life we want to live and it begins in our minds. This is the start of our voyage together.

I am going to ask you to do the following for yourself this week.

Stop asking others for permission or justification to be who you need to be, for you!

This is not easy, but it is necessary for your survival. The temptation to go back into that prison of your mind will be extremely compelling.

**Fight.**

Do not go back in.

This is the work.

This is your start.

This is your voyage.

The moment you decide and commit to only act in your best interest is the moment that you have stepped out of your prison.

**Your mind is greater than your environment.**

Never allow your environment to dictate your personal power.

*Sincerely,  
Dwayne Cyrus*
