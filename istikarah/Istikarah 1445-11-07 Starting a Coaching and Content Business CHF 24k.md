## The Response

Open: The Ranks

61:6 Hmm…Isa brought he message and people didn’t believe him…but now people follow him like he is God. Is this a warning? 

61:1-11 I believe there’s a warning in this…DO WHAT YOU SAY. You said you submit, so trust in Allah SWT, many signs have been given to you. Move in applied faith, today! This is your fight in the way of Allah SWT, this pleases Allah SWT. Remember to be in service for the pleasure of Allah SWT, and Allah SWT wok take care of you and your family. Alhamdulillah! 61:11

  

First: The Exile

59:16 All of this disbelief you have been carrying about this work is false. There is nothing to do with Allah SWT, and nor can you put blame on Shaitan. This is the works of your mind which you have control. Love in applied faith!

  

59:13-19 This is your test…your only fear is that of Allah SWT , you are being commanded to live in applied faith. Do not be a hypocrite, love what you speak! Dorothy what you can today, and be mindful of what you have left for tomorrow. 59:18 Meaning todays actions affect tomorrow be aware. The more you remember all, the more you will remember yourself (self-image), OH SNAP! 

  

Second: Crouching

45:16 Allah SWT is and has provided for you that you need so be grateful of this. Remember, and be grateful. Dude you just listened to a guy talk about being grateful often for you have not received yet as a work of applied faith. WOW! 

45:13-19 You have BEEN given clear proofs for this work, stop denying them. It is time four you to do good deeds with the path Allah SWT has set out 45:18 for you as a Muslim man. As long as you remain righteous and do the work, you will continue to be protected by Allah SWT, DO NOT EVER forget this. You are chooses by Allah SWT to do this work.

  

Third: The Calamity

101:1 I believe this is the day of judgement, but am I being told my work and how I go about this work will be weighed heavily? Or that this work will need me wrong? 

101:Surah Set your scales correctly by doing good works, many good works. For this life and the next! Look at this work as your opportunity to weigh heavy you scale with the amount of influence you can have. Let this day mark the end of your imposter, a calamity upon his existence.

  

Close The Morning Star

86:15 They…? Would this be the people of Shaitan, those who will work against my works? Tell me more, give me clarity.

  

86:Surah Okay, so do this work for the Muslims primarily. Start with your people, those who believe in Allah SWT, speak from there. You are protected, and what your are doing is giving life to something new in service of Allah SWT, move forward with that understanding.

  

Reflection

I am to live a life of applied faith, and to operate on this single focus and mission to educate and guide the people to the righteous path. Do this knowing that the more good you do, the more service you provide the more you are benefiting yourself. And Allah SWT is your protector in all things, so fear no man and work with this knowledge that you are chosen by good to do the work. Focus on service.
