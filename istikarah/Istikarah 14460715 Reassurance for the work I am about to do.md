### The Direction
*"O Allah! I seek goodness from Your Knowledge and with Your Power (and Might) I seek strength, and I ask from You Your Great Blessings, because You have the Power and I do not have the power. You Know everything and I do not know, and You have knowledge of the unseen. Oh Allah! If in Your Knowledge this action…*

**Where I am going with my service, my work, to guide, to teach, to write stories and draw. Please is those areas right for me it is where I am deciding to go.**

*...is better for my religion and faith, for my life and end death, for here in this world and the hereafter then make it destined for me and make it easy for me and then add blessings baraka' in it, for me. O Allah! In Your Knowledge if this action is bad for me, bad for my religion and faith, for my life and end death, for here in this world and the hereafter then turn it away from me and turn me away from it and whatever is better for me, ordain destine that for me and then make me satisfied with it."*
### The Response
**The Winnowing Winds**  
51:39 Is this what people will say about me or am I this for where I want to go?

51:36-42 I am being told what to do, is this what you want me to do? To maintain faith and move forward? Please Ya Rabb…

**Friday**  
62:4 Okay, this is where your bounty lies. Is there where I go for my provisions are even though I struggle to see? 

62:1-7 Ouch…I am not a wrong doer and I do carry a bunch of books, I must act and not just carry. Signs have been given to me and I need to just have blind faith in the works. Do it all.

**The Jinn**  
72:1 Okay, Allah SWT the flex, this made me smile. I think I get it now. Though I have gotten it for a long time, but denied myself.

72:1-4 I will not be like the foolish one, I will keep myself clear of the whisperer. I will follow the guidance blindly and act accordingly and immediately. Thank you Allah SWT!
### The Reflection
> But he turned away with his supporters and said, "A magician or a madman." That is the bounty of Allāh, which He gives to whom He wills, and Allāh is the possessor of great bounty. Say, "It has been revealed to me that a group of the jinn listened and said, 'Indeed, we have heard an amazing Qur’ān.

Allah SWT can bestow upon us humans greatness, and this makes us different. So different that we become strange to those who are not of our understanding. Following the righteous path is the only way towards success in this life and the next. The Qur'ān and the aligned knowledge from the previous Books is our reference for how to live well on this planet.
### The Understanding 
Guidance, Alhamdulillah! I have missed this connection with Allah SWT, but now it is time that I act and make good on my word to Allah SWT. Make the promise to Allah to fight for this. 

Ya Rabb, I promise. I will fight and keep to the path daily. Thank you I am grateful.
