## Foundational Knowledge

- Each little cluster of needs and business can be called a niche
- There a 3 big niches that are evergreen health, wealth, relationships and every human need and business can fit into one of these
- You cannot work in one of big needs as a whole, you need to narrow in as much as possible because the general needs tend to be dominated by major companies 
- Specific needs have less people than the general needs and less competition
- Focusing on specific needs allow you to generate profits of 80% and you want to work with clients of high margins
