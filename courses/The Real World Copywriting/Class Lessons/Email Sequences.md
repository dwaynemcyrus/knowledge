### How to write email sequences
How to use email to ascend customers up the value ladder
- Email is an extremely important tool, so you can use the same principles to plan out various forms of content
- The lessons here can apply to social media platforms, sms, etc.
- A person signing up to a brands email is a person signing up to join the brands world
- If the brand can shift a subscribers beliefs and nurture that relationship they can move them up the value ladder and generate lots of sales, develop huge scale, sell lots of product and have fans for life
- Different kinds of email sequences: welcomes email which is the opt-in email
- This is their first step into the brand and you want to hyper build the value and build rapport
- You don’t have to make each email a CTA to the next product. This would be called a ==value email== where you teach them a small lesson or direct them to a media asset like YouTube video, podcast episode, content that will help shift their beliefs
- Ask yourself where the person is and where they want to go and craft the sequence, what we have here is just an outline. Even if they don’t buy a product you want to ensure they are bought into the brand, addicted like Pavalov Dogs expirement 
- To get good at *welcome emails* signup to as many as possible in your swipe file as well to study what they are doing
- Normal Email is about giving them value think like a bank account every email is a deposit of value. Still include the DIC, PAS, and HSO just instead link to some free stuff and a micro CTA 
	* Your ratio of email should be 3:1 (value:sales) 
	* This is your regular content (value driven) email 

#### Email Stages
This sequence is also called the indoctrination sequence and this is where you begin to reshape their understanding of the world and to prepare them to Purchase the next product off the next step in the brand ladder.
1. Email 1 is a simple introduction and the actual bait they signed up for, and you will tease them with valuable content to expect in the next email
2. Email 2 is usually an HSO email where they get the opportunity to know the guru/brand, discovery their story, and shift some beliefs, to build report
3. Email 3 a pure value email to give them knowledge on how to overcome upcoming roadblocks to get to their dream state, often done with a DIC format. You can also just present the answer up front 
4. Email 4 is another DIC directing them to the product it’s 100% focused on driving newly educated and excited readers to go to the sales page, stack a lot of curiosity 
5. Email 5 is usually a PAS style email to help them get over the edge and visit a sales page for the product you want to up sell . They are already excited so this email is to crank up the emotions. This is to sell the next product on the ladder.

### Launch sequence email 
- These are for the release of a new product, event, and service to get people aware
- There’s often an announcement email a few weeks before the product becomes available to encourage pre-orders 
- Then you want to give a lot of value emails to amplify the pain/desire, educate on the solutions being solved, all this information focused around the new product
- After all the value emails, closer to the launch date you want a series of PAS email, once the product is available for purchase to amplify pain and desire 
- If there’s a sales period or time limit access there’s usually some high urgency PAS style email that go out at different  times letting the reader know they have 48 hour. "25 hour left etc. especially just before the final hours to close"
- Many businesses run several launches 🚀 in a cyclical pattern like every holiday for example 

### Reactivation Sequence
Overtime people will stop opening your email, so you don’t want to send emails to people who do not open it as email services track this and may move you to junk. With these customers you either want to reinstate them or cut them out.

**Steps Overview:** 
1. segment out the subscribers who have opened in x months
2. then send them a series letting them know they will be removed soon, you can bring them back in with a free offer. "click here if you want to stay” . You bribe them with discounts as well or a re-indoctrination with content similar to the welcome email. These email you to use high intrigue and curiosity building and heighten attention grabbing headers. You want them back into the brand 
3. Eventually there will be a breakup email . After that you filter them out your list to keep your quantity of open rate, high.

### Segmentation
- Modern email marketing software (EMS) is like Mailchimp, Active Campaign, etc
- These software allow you to segment email based on behaviour of the customers
- Allowing you to tag and filter ensures you can provide the most value to each group like men vs women
- ROI rule is you should earn $1/month for each subscriber 
- If you show up and a biz has 100k subs but only earner 20$k then you know you need to improve their email sequence and/or add new products to get more value per contact 
- Segmentation provides better experience
