## Summary

## Notes

## IMPORTANT - Manage your expectations
- This is where you really begin to write copy and it is going to feel difficult
- Don't allow the reality of your writing not being good get in your way or stop you
- You do not need to be perfect in order to continue moving
- The faster you get into practicing while maintaining consistency is your winning formula

### Weaponizing Attention and Curiosity
He who controls the Dopamine, controls the Universe
- How to grab their attention and direct them
- The first battle you have to win is their attention in the communication game
- So how do we stand out in this battlefield of attention?
	- You need to break the pattern, find a way to be different from the environment 
	- **You want to present one of two things Opportunity (Something they want) or Threat (Something they fear) whichever is most interesting to break the pattern**
	- Whichever you choose there needs to be a pot of dopamine at the end of it to hit the pleasure neurotransmitters. This is released when there’s something cool happening, but also when you are chasing something good. Example: scrolling by social media for the one post that stands out! When they find it, the brain gives a hit of dopamine which is an activity experience. Similar to back in the day when hunters were out searching for prey and would find it
	- You want to tease them into seeking out the rest of the dopamine hit, 
	- Whenever you present something to catch their attention, they need to know there’s a reward on the other side (dopamine), teasing that there is something valuable or dangerous or relevant to them down the line with your subject line and you need to tap into that
	- **Dopamine is what makes the world go around, we live in an attention based society, he who gives people dopamine in the right way, you have them doing whatever you want.** 
	- If you can dangle dopamine and have them chase some sort of future payoff (the reward and hit) you win
	- Adding curiosity, mystery, and intrigue are like dumping gasoline on the fire and if you can add that to your work you got them
- How do you engineer curiosity? This is about getting people to think there’s a hit here.
	- **Curiosity comes from information. An information gap creating a low level of anxiety (that eats at the person) that can only be resolved by answering the unanswered questions.** Something they don’t know, they may have a little bit of knowledge, but it is not complete, it’s a misunderstanding that they have. 
	- This feeling of it eating away at your mind (the thing you don’t know) it leaves you at the edge of your seat. This is similar to that of a cliffhanger in a show. It’s why people binge watch shows and are waiting months for a new season or movie sequel.
	- Have curiosity, mystery, and intrigue in everything that you write, within each step you want them to get a hit, it’s how you lead people. 
- Things that enhance curiosity.
	1. Specificity. It needs to feel real in their mind. The more specific details you can share without giving away the answer the better. “10 steps you must take to hit 10k on IG” having a number and being specific enough without giving everything. 
	2. Not Statements. The reader is going to have the best guess as to what the “answer” is if you tell him it’s NOT that thing… they’re mind will go into overdrive trying to figure it out. People like to guess what the rest is. **A good tactic is to tell people what it’s not to challenge their initial guess.** “It’s not keto, it’s not intermittent fasting, etc” especially when dealing with a sophisticated reader. You want the reader to think this is not what I thought it would be so let me find out what it is.
	3. Borrowed Status/Mystery. Secrets. Illuminati. Elon Musk. Ancient Knowledge. Humans gravitate to the secret and high status. Humans gravitate to the high status, the occult, the secret, so if you can connect it to something big and powerful, old and interesting, inherently you gain a lot of value. Secrecy with a big name connected to it creates mass appeal as well.
	4. Unexplainable. If the reader can’t quite figure out how something has happened (only if they think it’s real) they will have to try and figure it out. If you can present a map of reality to show people how to achieve real results it creates a search for the human to human connect, like “teach me, share the knowledge”. You want to give them proofs about something they do not understand about the world, peak their interest to want to know what it is you know. Give them a real thing to figure out.
- **Win the battle for their attention, and then keep them hooked with a constant drip of curiosity.** And there is no limit to what you can get your reader to do. Tease these humans with new mystery, new curiosity, and you can get them to go from not knowing about you to becoming raving fans. 
- You want to master the ability of building curiosity, and directing your reader’s attention. You need to do this from the beginning right to the end, winning every single battle to be a great copywriter.

### How to Write Fascinations 
The “Lego Blocks” of Copywriting 
- Before you can dive into writing emails landing pages and Facebook ads we need to learn about the smallest of building blocks as a copywriter, fascinations
- If you learn to write killer fascinations you have no problem capturing your readers attention, which is the first and hardest battle
- Mastering the art of fascinations literally will make the reader addicted to you
- What is a Fascination? F**ascination is a short line or two that combines desire with intrigue to create a potent effect in the mind of the reader.** And written well makes the reader rabbid to read the rest of your work and take action at the end. **You want to combine the thing they care about with intrigue, a specific tease, with a curiosity element is how you do it right. It creates a splinter in their mind.**
- Examples to get a feel of what this is like:
	- Headline the teachers favorite, “ wife of famous movie star swears under oath her new perfume does not contain an illegal sexual stimulant!”, there’s drama, specificity, intrigue, we need to now know what this perfume is.
	- “My weird hashtag strategy that helped me grow by 52,000 followers in one month!”, another headline. Specific details that one would care a lot about along with some mystery.
	- “Amazing secret discovered by one legged golfer adds 50 yards to your drives, eliminates hooks and slices… and can slash up to 10 strokes from your game almost overnight!”, another headline. It’s interesting and intrigues it just cannot be ignored by golfers. 
- Essentially all fascinations have two main elements
	1. An implied opportunity or threat
	2. Specific details that make a reader think that there’s something real on the other side, with enough information to create an information gap. If you are the Avatar you need to be compelled to solve the **fascination**.
- After research you will do a minimum of 100 fascinations as this is your ammunition 
- As you are out in the world, copy and document fascinations that you see in use
- **When you control curiosity you control attention and in turn control people, get great at fascinations** 

### Fascination Formulas
Formulas for winning fascinations with ease, combine them, mix them, etc.
#### How to 
Example: How to become a $10k/mo copywriter as quickly as possible
- "how to" is about swapping out curiosity and threats
#### Secret to
Example: The secret to writing killer fascinations everytime you sit down at your computer
#### Why
Example: Why most billionaire start their day in the exact same way
#### What
Example: What to do if you want to land your first copywriting client in less than 30 days
#### What NEVER
Example: What NEVER to say on a first date if you actually like the girl
- "What NEVER" is an inverse of the what, good to use for a threat
#### PLUS
Example: PLUS the exact phrase that will make her blush, smile, then fall deeply in love with you
- "PLUS" stacking fascinations back to back is a powerful technique
#### Number
Example: 7 Steps that guarantee you will reach your pushups goal each day
- "Number" is good because it give’s specificity 
#### ...Right? WRONG...
Example: Working smart is what will gaurantee your success, right? WRONG. Why working smart will never be enough and what you need to do instead.
- "Right? Wrong" is powerful to swap one’s thinking
#### Warning
Example: Warning - Don't email another client until you learn this new upsell question that will dramatically increase your closing price
- "Warning" can be overused be careful with these 
#### Are you...?'
Example: Are you afraid you'll get stuck with a depressing "white picket fence" life if you don't make real money NOW?
- "Are You?" Is a great way to connect emotionally and regardless of whether one answers the question, we as humans are hard wired to not ignore questions
#### Gimmick
Example: The writing "hack" that will force your reader to pay attention to EVERY. SINGLE. WORD.
#### Sneaky
Example: The sneaky headline formula that will break your reader's mind and double or even triple your sales
- "Sneaky" tend to imply novelty and curiosity using strange words
#### Direct benefit
Example: BECOME THE STRONGEST MAN IN YOUR GYM IN 30 DAYS OR LESS
- "Direct" give a big bold benefit upfront
#### Specific question
Example: Did you know that 99% of billionaires used the same strategy to make their first real money?
- "Specific questions" tend to hit the core roadblock, the crux
#### If... Then...
Example: If you are tired of falling flat on your face when talking with that beautiful girl, then you need to learn the 7 questions that will get any girl wildly interested in you.
"If...then..." desire/fear/pain then specificity, curiosity/tease
#### When
Example: *"When eating chocolate will actually boost your fat loss"*
"When" relates to times and is not used as often
#### Quickest, Easiest
Example: *The quickest way to boost your confidence and get that millionaire "glow"*
"Quickest, Easiest" implies novelty and superiority, these adjectives amplify curiosity
#### Truth
Example: *The truth about trading crypto that will ensure you're on the right side of history*
"Truth" implies information gap to avoid pain and or solve problem, a powerful formula
#### Better than
Example: *Better than caffeine. Discover the best (legal) supplement for greater focus and discipline*
"Better than" solution based over product and sets the readers expectations
#### Single
Example: The single step you must take before all of your sales calls to maintain frame and close like the Wolf of Wall Street
"Single" adds importance to the topic, magnifies the importance, makes the information gap they have seem smaller and compels them to want to solve it, and take action

### Things that Enhance Curiosity
1. **Specificity.** It needs to feel real in their mind. The more specific details you can share without giving away the answer the better.
2. **Not Statements.** The reader is going to have a best guess as to what the "answer" is if you tell him it's NOT that thing... they're mind will go into overdrive trying to figure it out.
3. **Borrowed Status/Mystery.** Secrets. Illuminati. Elon Musk. Ancient Knowledge. Humans gravitate to the secret and high status.
4. **Unexplainable.** If the reader can't quite figure out how something has happened (only if they think it's real) they will have to try and figure it out.
5. **Conflict/Drama.** Humans are naturally drawn to conflict. Leverage it.
   The more you can add attracts people to want to know more to get to the root conflict.

### The Creative Thinking Process
How to come up with genius ideas and conquer the world 
- Now you get to write, it’s the first time you write
- The quality of your thinking determines the quality of your success
- These concepts and process will allow you to disrupt entire markets, it’s how you change business, the world, and self
- You need to understand your brain and how it functions to produce the most creative works
- There are two parts to your brain 
	- Subconscious mind: the bottom part of the iceberg controls your memories, gives you thoughts, the workhorse, where your creativity lies, math, facts, “phone number memory”
	- Conscious mind will direct the subconscious and is above it
- How they work together
	1. Conscious mind sets the intention, asks the questions 
	2. Sub mind begins to generate ideas, this is divergent thinking
	3. Conscious mind filters the ideas, choosing the best of, this is convergent thinking 
- The process seems simple, but the thinking often breaks apart for a few reasons
	- Distraction: this is where Deep Work is required to keep your momentum going, this is why most people cannot think deeply. Cut out distractions in your life to develop deeper thinking. 
	- Lack of material to work with to begin the creative process: These tends to stem from poor research and preparation, you need clarity on the Avater, Problems, Desires, Roadblocks, Solutions, Product. It’s usually a lack of understanding in the Process of the work (how to do a step) or the lack of material for the work 
	- Too harsh of a filter too early on: if everything you come up with, you bad talk it the sub mind will stop coming by up with ideas. It’s kinda like another person you are dealing with, you kill their motivation. The way to kill this is to turn off the filter by pushing yourself to write 100 horrible fascinations. 
	- The brain is overtaxed: too many deep work sessions, your brain requires time to reset itself, go for a 5 min walk like in *[[The Artist’s Way]]*, filling the well activities like washing dishes 
- Develop this skill of creative thinking and you will never face a challenge you cannot overcome

### How to Evaluate and Improve your Writing
The keys to ensuring quality writing and actually producing results
- This is the part after you write, it’s the key to ensure quality and all writing is meant to achieve a result in the mind of the reader
- It’s not enough to just brain dump, you need to go back and review your writing to ensure it will achieve the results like design
- Writing is an iterative process like the OODA from the first lesson
- Step 1 You need to sit and read your copy out loud in your voice, it allows you to perceive it as though you are the avatar
- Step 2 As you read examine how the reader will be affected. By the reading, our job is to orchestrate the experience. If you reach a point that doesn’t work, reverse engineer, looking for and asking “how can I trigger the effect I want?”
- Step 3 Grammar and spellcheck do this at the end to ensure you have the correct words. Teacher Quote from military, *”How you do the little things is how you do the big things is how you do everything”*. Poor grammar and spelling makes you look like an amatuer and causes the reader to think of this as your best, then the product must be just as bad or worse. Use grammarly.com and Hemingwayapp.com and other tools to perfect grammar and spelling.
- Always review your copy it’s not done until you have iterated 3 times, you will learn more after reviewing other people's copy, it is how you make sure your copy produces.
