### The Direction
*"O Allah! I seek goodness from Your Knowledge and with Your Power (and Might) I seek strength, and I ask from You Your Great Blessings, because You have the Power and I do not have the power. You Know everything and I do not know, and You have knowledge of the unseen. Oh Allah! If in Your Knowledge this action…*

**of providing 1-1, group, and communal guidance trauma recovery, emotional mastery, and creative expression towards righteous living to earn 240’000 CHF at 96% margins in monthly reoccurring profits after a maximum 24% tax cut**

*...is better for my religion and faith, for my life and end death, for here in this world and the hereafter then make it destined for me and make it easy for me and then add blessings baraka' in it, for me. O Allah! In Your Knowledge if this action is bad for me, bad for my religion and faith, for my life and end death, for here in this world and the hereafter then turn it away from me and turn me away from it and whatever is better for me, ordain destine that for me and then make me satisfied with it."*
### The Response
**The Inner Apartments**  
49:13 Wow, okay…please more…
49:10-16 Do this a keep peace with fellow believers. Do not turn into a people of back biters and gossipers. You must submit yourself to Allah SWT and the work! 

**The Heights**  
7:1 Ya Allah SWT, this I do now know. I don’t think anyone knows.
71:1-4 This is your calling like the Prophet so do not stress over the work or fear doing the work. Do not let anxiety get you! Follow the signs that have been given to you and nothing else. And DO NOT sleep-in and waste the day.

**The Traducer**  
104:2 Collecting wealth and counts it…this seems well, but I’m sure this referred to greedy people in its full contxt. Is this a reminder to not focus on the money, but instead the service? 
104:1-5 Be mindful and remember and fear the judgement of Allah SWT, DO NOT allow this work to corrupt you in any way.
### The Reflection
> O mankind, indeed We have created you from male and female and made you peoples and tribes that you may know one another. Indeed, the most noble of you in the sight of Allāh is the most righteous of you. Indeed, Allāh is Knowing and Aware.
> Alif, Lām, Meem, Ṣād.
> Who collects wealth and counts it

You are to collect t the people and be the example amongst them. Never allow your character to become corrupted. Keep your heart cleansed.
