I no longer want to be killing myself.

  

I want to quit this life, I want to kill this self.

  

I no longer want to be.

  

So…

  

I am a man. As a man I am blank, I decide who and what I am to become at any point in my life. 

  

This is true.

  

I want to kill this self, so kill him. You want to become, so decide.

  

Well to kill myself I must come clean I must let go of it all!!!
