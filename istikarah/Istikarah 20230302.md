**Istikarah**

  

Is me going all in on being an artist as my career the best move me? I know you told me before that’s where my wealth is so I need to know if this still holds true. 

  

Open: 107:7 I don’t understand what it is to withhold. // Surah is this a warning to myself about withholding from my artist child from me? More clarity please Allah

  

First: 13:38 Is this. Reinforcement of what was previously sent to me? Have I been foolish in not taking the message as a decree of what I must do? 

  

Second: 82:11 I need more but are stating that this work would be noble and well documented? // 8-14 The erm Recompense has come up again…. Dwayne why do you not have faith? This would be the greatest “risk” that you can involve yourself into. 

  

Third: 73:14 This seems like a further warning and again about the Day. Is this an hint at moving with speed? Or this a angerAllah has of me for not listening? // 8-17 Trust in Allah … why be afraid when you believe in Allah and the word that you are given. Move in faith Dwayne. 

  

Close: 27:7 More evidence of the trust in Allah. Towards fire the fear of all Allah creation and he obeyed and was brought out of pain. This you must do the same. // 4-10 Reinforcement of th me trust that Moses displayed Model after Moses.
