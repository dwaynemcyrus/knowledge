Tier 3 Onboarding Covenant — The Iron Watch

  

⸻

  

Tier 3 — The Iron Watch

  

Onboarding Covenant

Status: Active | Client-Facing (after payment)

  

⸻

  

Welcome

  

This is not a program.

This is not support.

  

This is a crucible of duty.

  

You are here because you’ve already proven presence in the fleet.

Now you will be tested under constant fire.

  

You will not hide.

You will not drift.

You will not break presence.

  

From this moment, you are under Watch.

  

⸻

  

Structure

• Duration: 4 months

• Cohort Size: 12 men maximum, fixed. No mid-cycle entry.

• Group Councils: Weekly 90-minute sessions — hot-seats, drills, counsel, and correction.

• Brotherhood Pairs: Fixed for the full cycle. His drift is your drift. His presence is your presence.

• Assignments & Challenges: Weekly tactical work that demands proof, not talk. Completion required.

• Bi-Weekly Check-Ins: Every two weeks, you submit a sharp accountability report in the Watch Thread. No drift. No delays.

• Midpoint Evaluation: At 2 months, you will stand before the Watch to measure your weak point and progress. Presence is mandatory.

• Final Watch: At 4 months, you stand evaluation again — proving what you’ve built.

• Inspection Call: Completed before entry. Your weak point is recorded and will be declared publicly.

• Exit Call: At the end, you will face a private review to measure the man who entered against the man who leaves.

The First Watch

  

The cohort begins with The First Watch.

  

Here you will:

• Speak the Watch Oath aloud in front of your brothers.

• Be assigned your brotherhood pair.

• Declare your weak point publicly — the same one revealed in your inspection.

• Begin the first training arc and receive your first assignment.

  

From that moment, the Watch is sealed. Duty has begun.

  

⸻

  

The Watch Oath

  

You will be given the Watch Oath as a separate covenant document.

  

You are required to:

• Speak it aloud during The First Watch.

• Post it in the Watch Thread along with your weak point, where it remains for the duration of the cohort.

  

Once spoken and posted, your words no longer belong to you.

They belong to the Watch.

  

⸻

  

Standards

• You will show up on time.

• You will submit all check-ins and assignments by the deadline.

• You will not hide, deflect, or posture.

• Drift, ghosting, or excuses = immediate removal.

  

If you fail to hold presence, you will be removed clean.

Re-entry is only at my discretion — 3, 6, or 12 months later, or never.

  

⸻

  

Core Principles

• Presence is duty.

• No man hides on Watch.

• The Watch does not break — you break or you rise.

• Weakness is not hidden. It is confronted.

• Proof over talk.

• You are corrected, not coddled.

  

⸻

  

Terms

• 4-month container

• 2’400 CHF/month

• Stripe payment only

• No refunds. No discounts.

  

⸻

  

Final Word

  

This is not a classroom.

This is not therapy.

  

This is duty under fire.

The Watch is not broken for you. You are broken and rebuilt by the Watch.

  

Stand your duty — or be exposed.

  

⸻

  

⚓ This Covenant is now:

• Client-facing (handed after payment).

• Seamlessly aligned with the Offer Letter and Flow Map.

• Points to the separate Watch Oath document for ritual law.
