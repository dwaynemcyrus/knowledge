The Ask of Allah
Pursuing strict discipline in my practice of Islam with a deep understanding of the Qur’an, Sunnah, Rights, and history of Islam as a Hafiz Qur’an developing a beautifully trained voice for recitation and the call to prayer.

83:27 — Accomplish this and you will be deeply blessed by Allah SWT like that of [[Tasneem]] from [[jannah paradise]]
2:224 — Your Oath is not excuse for anything, you maintain good character, righteousness as a Muslim
3:77 — Keep your word and do not waiver on your responsibilities as a Muslim for anything! Like your initial recordings
29:47 — Prioritize your book, study it, increase your belief in it
105:5 — Allah SWT will protect you against anything or one that seeks to harm your practice of Islam.
