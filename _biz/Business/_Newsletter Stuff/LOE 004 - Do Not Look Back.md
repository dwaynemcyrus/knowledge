Looking back leads to getting stuck.

This past week has been full of temptation. The temptation to look back and return to the comfort of self-imposed misery.

To re-enter the prison of my mind.

To be comforted by the familiarity of past misery.

To avoid the threat of the unknown future.

I got stuck in analysis paralysis. Looking back felt comfortable, very comfortable. Doing all the old self-destructive habits was familiar, too familiar.

Pacing, planning, delaying, just doing busy work to *"feel"* productive.

It felt safe.

Eventually, I snapped out of it when it came time to make Salat. I looked at the time and realized that I had lost hours with nothing to show for it.

So I wrote. I got my feelings of frustration out on the page. I made a **decision**, not a choice.

I decided that I will no longer look back and I will fight the urge to do so at every opportunity.

A decision is a great start, and a support system is required. For me, I have set alarms every 2-3 hours to remind me to check in with myself. To give me a reality check on what it is that I am doing versus what I mean to be doing to push my life forward.

**This is how we take control.**

Must we go to war with the temptation and avoid the comforts of the self-imposed prison.

Sincerely,
