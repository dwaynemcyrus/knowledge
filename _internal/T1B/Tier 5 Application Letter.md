Tier 5 Application Form

  

⚔️ Perfect — the application is the gate. It must feel serious enough to filter drifters, but not so heavy that it blocks good men at the door.

  

Here’s how we’ll build it: 

  

⸻

  

Tier 5 — The Harbor

  

Application for Entry

  

⚓ Instructions

• Fill this out in full. Half-answers = rejection.

• Keep your answers sharp and direct. No stories, no fluff.

• Once submitted, you will receive an email with the next steps for review and onboarding.

  

⸻

  

1. Name & Email

  

(This locks you into the fleet ledger and adds you to the Harbor list.)

  

⸻

  

2. Where are you in life right now?

• Short answer (2–3 sentences).

• Example: “I lead a small business, married with two kids, but I’m drifting in discipline.”

  

⸻

  

3. Why The Harbor?

• What pulled you here instead of another group or community?

• Short answer (3–4 sentences).

  

⸻

  

4. What is the biggest drift or weakness you’re facing?

• Name it directly.

• One sentence only.

• Example: “I collapse into distraction when stress hits.”

  

⸻

  

5. What do you want out of The Harbor?

• One outcome, one line.

• Example: “A place to anchor my discipline and sharpen weekly.”

  

⸻

  

6. Commitment Check

• Tick box: “I understand The Harbor does not rescue me. Presence is required. Drift = removal.”

  

⸻

  

7. Signature of Application

  

Type your full name. This is your first commitment.

⚓ Blunt Notes for Ops:

• This form should live in MailerLite (form/landing page) or Tally (embed).

• Submission auto-adds to The Harbor list.

• Auto-reply email = “Your application is received. Decisions go out Thursday. If accepted, payment is due Saturday. Onboarding is Sunday.”

  

⸻

  

Do you want me to also draft the auto-reply email copy (what they receive after submitting the application) so the funnel is seamless from the start?
