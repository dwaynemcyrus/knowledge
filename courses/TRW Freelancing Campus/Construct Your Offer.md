## Be Specific Not Random
- Do not say what you do in generics, “I do email copywriting”
- Specific sounds like the following, “I do email copywriting for people selling info products”
- Being specific allows them to quickly identify with you
- Do not try and do everything, be focused and do one thing
## The Archetype Strategy 
- You need an archetype for the type of client you want to work with 
- Ideal is X amount of followers and a level of engagement and has a product/service for sale
- Be very specific about the product they are offering
- You can also create a customer avatar for who the client is working for and with (their customer)
- Work for your clients are called deliverables
