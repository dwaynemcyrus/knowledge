**August 12 Istikarah** 

  

Istikarah 

  

I am angry and upset and hurting, how do I stop killing myself? 

  

Open 111:4 (1-5) Ya Allah is this a tell for punishment or are we speaking on the pain I’m inflicting up myself and you are letting me know that you know and see all. 

  

I’m carrying the wrong thing aren’t eye? I am ya rabbi know that I am. Sigh… to the old me the broken me 

  

21:47 (45-49) All of what I do is being accounted for I need to make sincere Tawbah for my sins and for not living as a Muslim and keeping my word to myself and to Allah and to others. Allah is taking account of it all! 

  

56:39 This reminds me of the work Allah told me to do last Istikarah to deepen my knowledge. To study the first gen of Muslims the Sahabah in particular, learn their stories! 

  

13:17 I need speak truth like Allah my frustrations is in my silencing of myself. So deepen yourself into the being of a Muslim! Bathe yourself into that which is Islam.
