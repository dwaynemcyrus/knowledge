description: Happiness and success are goals we all strive for. But how do we achieve these goals, and how do we protect ourselves if we fail? The answer lies within the power of the mind. Dr. Joseph Murphy, one of the world's best—known authorities on the power of the subconscious mind, shows readers not only how to unleash this power, but how to harness it and effectively use it to change their lives. Fully updated to reflect the sensibilities of the 21st century, this revised edition of a self—help classic is the key to overcoming the psychological barriers that stand in the way of greater material, spiritual, and emotional wealth.
