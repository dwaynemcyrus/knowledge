## Notes
### What is Social Media Really?
- It’s about the conversation
- It’s building connection with the audience
- It’s not about boosting your ego
- It’s about bridging the gap between your service and the client, building rapport
- It’s not about content, it’s about building conversation, always add to the conversation 
### Can You Be Anonymous?
- Putting your face out there’s isn’t something you need to be fearful of, don’t limit yourself
- Using your face is a part of social proof
- You can create a business avatar 
- At the very least use your name 
### Does Your Following Count Matter
- It matters very little
- You do not need a ton of followers 
- What you need is a good header, bio, and proof of what you can do for them
- Do not overthink this, business was always being done long before social media
- All that matters is what you know and can you deliver
