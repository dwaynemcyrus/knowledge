## Summary
Covered some of the fundamentals of using the Obsidian application with little beneficial information. She also added a brief overview of the shortcuts that can be used and that was good.

## Highlights
- In your template have sections for the following...
	- Related: it reminded you off
	- Takeaway: the lesson here
	- ToDo: things to make like a YouTube video 
- Note taking is about building connections to what you already know and are now learning and would like to learn 

### Functions
- Cmd + N: Creates a new note
- Cmd + Shift + N: Creates a new note in new pane
- Double Square Brackets: Creates an internal link
- Cmd + Click: Opens an internal link to make a new note
- Cmd + E: Switch between edit and read
- Add an image drag and drop
- Use tags to remind you of your thinking (what comes to our mind specifically) not to categorize 

### Style
- Makes use of all the Markdown that you already know

### Lists
* Makes use of all the Markdown that you already know

### Views
- Cmd + Click: Opens in a new pane
- If you want to scroll the same document in two views edit vs view click the top right to link 

### Plug-ins
- Be sure to setup your templates folder in the settings
- Auto filling info with the curly bracket codes
- Random note opener is good to bring up new people inspiration and potentially older notes you have not seen in a while
- Star feature is a good way to mark frequently accessed files
