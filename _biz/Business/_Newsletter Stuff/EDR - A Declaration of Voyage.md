## Draft
### Lesson of the Week
Every time you don’t do it, is another day you slowly kill your spirit.

Everyday you look at yourself in the mirror your mind begins to reflect on what you know you must be doing, and are not. You are killing dreams and you know it.

Yet, you still don’t do it. I still do it.

The resentment you have for yourself is growing, slowly become a form of self abuse. 

This has been me for year's, and still is. On and off with myself, sometimes walking, sometimes running, often crawling. Lost in a maze of my own creation in a desperate desire to live life on my own terms.

We do not need to remain trapped in our minds and in-turn living a life that does not suit who we are. A fife that does not reflect our values and stands as a testament to our individual greatness.

A conscious decision must be made to keep out of cage and ignore the the maze that our [[lizard brain]] would prefer us to operate in. 

**Decide and declare**.

to end the cycle of self-abuse for the sake of fitting in to be “accepted” by others who genuinely do not care.

This will be difficult. It will be painful. 

It will require  take my complete commitment to holding on to my vision of a better a life. To no longer hold myself back, or be trapped by the desires and demands of others in my life. 






## We Are Now Voyager! 
announce the website with the resources… when you buy the domain.


The plan for this newsletter is to document the creation of a blueprint for you to be able to follow and make use of to take change your life from wherever you are to where you want it to be. 

  

All designed and controlled no other than you!

  

I am a survivor of various forms of abuse particularly sexual from a child to an adult. Having spent the past 12 years with various professionals, mentors, and my own self education to understand and come to terms with what had happened to me.

  

Currently I am at a point in life where I can truly begin to decide my future. No more choice-making it is all about decisions from this point forward.

  

This is my invitation for you to join me. To learn from my experiences as I share them.

  

I want for you, what I want for myself, and that is complete control over my life in every possible aspect, living completely expressed. EVERY. SINGLE. DAY.

  

I sincerely hope that my words here each week act as a catalyst for your own voyage.

  

With much respect and gratitude

-   Cyrus 

  

PS: I'll be making use of a developing system in Notion tohelp me keep clear on my direction, tracking progress, and documenting the journey. I’ll be working towards making my templates available as I progress.
