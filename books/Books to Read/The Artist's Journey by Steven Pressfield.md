description: "I have a theory about the Hero's Journey. We all have one. We have many, in fact. But our primary hero's journey is the passage we live out, in real life, before we find our calling. The hero's journey ends when, like Odysseus, we return home to Ithaca, to the place from which we started. What then? The passage that comes next is The Artist's Journey. On our artist's journey, we move past Resistance and past self-sabotage. We discover our true selves and our authentic calling, and we produce the works we were born to create. You are an artist too-whether you realize it or not, whether you like it or not-and you have an artist's journey. Will you live it out? Will you follow your Muse and do the work you were born to do? Ready or not, you are called."--Back cover.
