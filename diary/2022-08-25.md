@0155 I finally hit publish on the YouTube video, and I feel… I don’t know but I did it! 
I don’t feel good about it though. All I am thinking of is what needs to be done next ya know. 

@0243 Here I am awake and the wrong time of the day, making some quick food for myself. 

@0326 What do I need for myself today? A few things will make today amazing. 
Here’s the list…
- Personal website is live with my schedule
- 6 hours of work on my copywriting 
- Wellness Wednesday preparation and delivery
Now what is it that you need guidance on now? What are we to ask Allah for?

I have no damn clue.

@0510 Alright I have made all of my morning worship and asks of Allah. It is now time to get to work! 

0522-0815 Copywriting HU

0753 I just realized how dangerous I am. Emotionally intelligent with great people skills I can build connections with multiple people,  graphic design so i know how to get peoples attention, now I am adding copywriting the ability to manipulate with words to get an action. 

HOLY SNOKES! Why have I never put this together and why aren’t I monetizing? Not to mention I can synthesize knowledge quickly, teach it, and am a visually appealing face to look at with a soothing voice.

0815 I have learned a ton of the past 3 hours and I think a hit a point of deminishing returns with my studies at the moment, so I will stop. I will put some work into umm listening to my next YouTube video to release.

@0955 So I been downloading my remaining TikTok lives so I can have a sense of the material. Took a break and stopped into the Irish Muslims YouTube live and he gave me mad props and referred to me as the OG of womens rights online and bettering men. Subhan’Allah!!! This is another sign from Allah! 

We also set a time to run a live together to discuss the issues of Muslim men.

@1637 I am up… I feel asleep around 1200 so this is good I got close to my ideal sleep of 5-6 hours

@2247 Todays live was great! You are really really good at what you do! Let’s note real quick some points from the live [[Hw to deal with Overthinking & rumination]]

## Connection...

### Ask
How do I maintain my focus in order to completely change my life to become the best of me?
Open: 64:15 Your wealth is a trial bruh, you want it you need to fight for it through Allah. (14-17) Keep to Allah and spend in the cause of Allah and Allah will double it for you! Stop questioning what Allah has but down for you embrace it submit to the work and do what is necessary to see it through. [ Add this to your daily read]

65:5 Listen to and focus on Allah and Allah alone! Live by the Qur’an study the Qur’an! Ask you elder how to capitalize on my gift, show him what you are thinking of doing.

40:15 Wait Allah are you telling me that I have been chosen to speak and to be a reminder to others? Yes, you have you told me earlier this week! So to focus I need to focus on my work for Allah through my works on self? Through the Qur’an. 

49:2 Be mindful of you voice pay attention and use it, like JT mentioned hold to your way of speech! 

Closing: 58:1 Allah hears all that is in your heart, it okay, speak!
