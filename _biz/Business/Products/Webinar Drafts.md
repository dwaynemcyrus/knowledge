Preframing

Outline

  

Opening

Men as a group are suffering in pain, silently and in isolation. Chances are, you are one of these men. Angry, depressed, frustrated with no one who cares to understand.

  

You are not alone and I am honored to have you here today. Congratulations on taking the steps towards living a life on your terms.

  

It takes courage. Lots of courage for a man to acknowledge his flaws and be aware of his pain. 

  

I am here for you. This community is here for you. We are here for you.

  

To put things in perspective, you are in the right place at the right time.

  

So let’s get started.

  

Definitions

As men {of faith}, I’d like to begin with an outline of topics that we will be discussing. Essentially, these are aspects of our lives that are critical to our roles as men. They are equally important in our development or destruction.

  

It's all a matter of perspective. 

  

- The Self: The standards by which we govern our behaviour as a reflection of our environment.
    

- Social Norms: How our roles are informed by our interactions within the community and at home.
    

  

- Money: Financial literacy or lack of dictates your discipline and relationship with money. 
    

  

- Emotions: How we regulate our feeling between the outside world and our thoughts. 
    

  

- Relationships: Our ability to effectively communicate our wants and needs.
    

  

Most of us need to shift our perspective, to shift our trajectory.

  

Sadly, we’re paralyzed by fear.

  

Self:

  

Isolation: Social norms often dictate that men should be self-reliant and not show vulnerability. This can lead to isolation when men are hesitant to reach out for support or share their emotions.

  

Example: John, a young man dealing with stress from work and personal issues, avoids talking about his feelings with friends because he fears they might perceive him as weak.

  

Feel Silenced: Men may feel pressured to suppress their emotions, which can lead to a sense of being silenced or unheard.

  

Example: Mark is struggling with anxiety, but he feels unable to express his feelings to his family because they've always seen him as the "strong" one who doesn't show vulnerability.

  

Lack of a Voice: Societal norms might overshadow men's emotional needs, making it difficult for them to assert themselves emotionally.

  

Example: James wants to discuss his concerns about his career with his partner, but he hesitates because he's afraid of seeming indecisive or unsure.

  

Depression: The stigma surrounding men's mental health can prevent them from seeking help for depression.

  

Example: David is experiencing signs of depression, but he avoids seeking therapy because he worries that people might think he's not capable of handling his emotions.

  

Addictions: Cultural norms that discourage emotional expression can drive men towards using addictive behaviors like pornography or alcohol as coping mechanisms.

  

Example: Michael turns to alcohol to numb his emotions after a breakup because he doesn't feel comfortable discussing his heartbreak with friends.

  

Clash of Cultural Identity: Men may grapple with fitting into societal expectations of masculinity while also embracing their own identity.

  

Example: Carlos faces pressure to conform to traditional masculinity norms from his family, but he identifies as more sensitive and emotional, causing an inner conflict.

  

Social:

  

Lack of Brotherhood: Cultural norms sometimes discourage meaningful emotional connections between men, limiting the support they can offer one another.

  

Example: Eric finds it challenging to establish deep friendships with other men, as they often bond over surface-level topics and avoid discussing their feelings.

  

Destroying Masculinity: The narrow definition of masculinity can lead to self-doubt and shame if men don't align with these expectations. [Media and feminism’s influence]

  

Example: Jason struggles with his self-esteem because he's passionate about art and poetry, which he perceives as conflicting with the "tough guy" image he thinks he should project.

  

Ideal Role Ideals/Expectations: Societal norms often prescribe specific roles for men, leaving little room for individuality.

  

Example: Sam feels conflicted because he wants to pursue a career in dance, but societal expectations pressure him to choose a more traditional path.

  

Lack of Role Models/Mentorship: Men may lack relatable role models or mentors who can guide them in navigating life's challenges.

  

Example: Alex wishes he had someone older to share their experiences and advice about relationships and career decisions.

  

Respect and Status: Societal norms link a man's worth to his success and status, putting immense pressure on men to constantly prove themselves.

  

Example: Thomas feels inadequate because he hasn't achieved the level of professional success that his family and society value.

  

Money:

  

Lack of Financial Education: Societal norms might discourage open discussions about money and finances, leaving men ill-equipped to manage their financial well-being.

  

Example: Kevin struggles with budgeting and saving because he never received proper financial education, which makes him vulnerable to financial stress.

  

Financial Responsibilities: Traditional gender roles can place the burden of financial provision solely on men, causing stress and pressure to meet these expectations.

  

Example: Mark feels immense pressure to be the primary breadwinner for his family, even though his partner is also working.

  

Career Trajectories: Societal norms can push men towards specific career paths, limiting their choices and causing dissatisfaction.

  

Example: Brian chose a career in law due to societal pressure, but he's unfulfilled and wishes he could pursue his passion for environmental science.

  

Emotions:

  

Lack of Inspiration: Men might struggle to find sources of inspiration that resonate with their authentic emotions, as societal norms often discourage emotional exploration.

  

Example: Chris feels stuck in a rut because he can't connect with traditional forms of motivation that are centered around competition and success.

  

Generational Trauma: Men might inherit unspoken emotional challenges from their fathers or forefathers due to societal norms that discourage emotional expression.

Example: Andrew carries unresolved trauma from his father's emotionally distant upbringing, affecting his ability to connect emotionally with his own children.

  

Confusion around What is Man: Shifting societal norms can lead to confusion about the definition of masculinity, causing internal conflict.

  

Example: Jordan struggles to define what it means to be a "real man" because societal expectations seem to be constantly changing.

  

Relationships:

  

Divorce: Men might face challenges in coping with divorce, as traditional masculinity norms may discourage seeking emotional support during this time.

  

Example: Daniel avoids talking about his emotional struggles after his divorce because he's afraid people will perceive him as weak.

  

Marriage: Roles in the Home: Traditional gender roles can create conflict in marriages when partners don't fit into expected roles.

  

Example: Mike's marriage suffers because he's expected to be the sole provider, and his partner resents not having the opportunity to pursue her career aspirations.

  

Courtship: Societal norms around courtship and dating can pressure men to initiate and take the lead, causing anxiety and fear of rejection.

  

Example: Alex hesitates to ask out someone he's interested in because he worries about being perceived as too forward or aggressive.

  

Family Pressures/Influences: Family expectations and cultural norms might force men into life choices that don't align with their authentic desires.

  

Example: Miguel faces pressure from his family to follow in his father's footsteps, even though he dreams of pursuing a different career path.

  

Raising Children: Changing norms of fatherhood can create uncertainty about how to balance providing for the family and being emotionally present for children.

  

Example: Robert struggles to connect with his children emotionally because he was raised with the belief that his primary role is to provide financial support.

Opening

Men are in pain for many reasons, some social, others deeply personal. Perhaps you’re one of those men. Struggling in silence, feeling alone and frustrated.

## Purpose Work
**

# 01 Purpose Work

We make use of the book Ikigai by with Voyager’s customized process document to define your purpose and reason for being.

  

## Phase 01

Fill out each document with a full exploration of yourself, nothing is off the table just be honest with yourself and go at it in the following order: Love Doing, Good At, World Needs, then Paid.

  

Steps

1. Brain dump into all of the areas that fit each category based on their prompts.
    
2. Refine and organize your lists by giving them numbers, and these numbers are not based on any order or hierarchy
    

Work Sheets

- Love Doing
    
- Good At
    
- World Needs
    
- Paid For
    

## Phase 02

You are going to seek out complimentary connections between each category list. You are looking at the overlaps in reference to the diagram example.

  

Steps

1. Making complimentary connections (links/themes) between the categories of "good at" "world needs", etc. You want to find what combinations work well together, as many as possible. Starting with what the world, paid, good ,and then love. This part is best done on paper and or with digital stickies, white boarding ya know! Use this area to document the themes you came up with...go for quantity over quality, have fun.
    
2. Remove any connection that do not give you an opportunity to be paid in a relatively obvious way.
    
3. For each list you want to pull out the top 9-12 items that rank the highest for you.
    

Work Files

Lastly, you will describe your One Person, this is who you need to impact most, and where your legacy will primarily be built on.

Work

Your Story

Your People

## Phase 02

We need to gain an understanding for what would be most valuable to the people we are going to be serving to build our legacy upon. We will be making use of the Value Proposition Design by Alexander Osterwalder process.

  

Steps

Name/Describe each legacy profile in 2-3 words

Brainstorm and list out the jobs, pains, and lastly the gains for each profile

Rank each category with their respective measures

Brainstorm and list out the products & services, pain relievers, and gain creators for each profile

Based on your One Person profile fill out the top 3-6 jobs, pains, and gains

Based on your One Person profile fill out the top 3-6 products & services, pain relievers, and gain creators

Work

Profile - The One Person

We will get clear on the person we are speaking to and working towards impacting the most in our everyday life through some form of documentation.

  

Steps

Copy your One Person description into the Avatar Statement document

Fill in the top 3 components per section of statement.

Based on the One Person profile you will now create your legacy statement.

Imagine and describe the impact that you will leave based on your statement

Work

This is where we need to look at where you want to be at in 10 - 50 per-say, as in what is the vision of this. Or these are your big picture visions that you are pushing to achieve in the next 5-10 years =D. When filling out the visions we...want to keep it to a maximum of 1-3 items, preferably in this order starting from the current year 2, 3, 4 or to encourage clarity and focus.

  

## Phase 01

Steps

Define all of the areas or pillars of your life to keep your attention on and rate each one in the front matter.

For each pillar you want to define how it will serve as an act of worship to Allah for the sake of your Akhirah in a sentence or two.

Based on the areas of your life you will describe in detail what they will look like in 10 years, your vision along with the intention of how this area will be an act of worship

Fill out the outcome you want to create this year, make sure each is written in the present as though you already have in along with an “I am” statement of belief.

Go over each area and make Istikarah to check what Allah SWT has to say about this.
