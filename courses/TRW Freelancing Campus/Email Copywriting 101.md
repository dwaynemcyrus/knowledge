Writing the email

- Whenever we transfer to a different point we bold and use the dots at the end of the line
- Always ask yourself, “Can I say this without the extra words?”
- Avoid saying “make money online” this is one of the words that can move your email to spam
- Always avoid discounting your products, it conditions the customers to only buy at those times instead add bonuses
- Using buttons work best for call to actions or use “>>> Enroll Now” or the text in all caps or “click the link down below and I will see you inside”
- At the end of the email always have a sign off signature
- After the signature sparingly use the “PS:”
