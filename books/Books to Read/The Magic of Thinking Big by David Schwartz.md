description: The timeless and practical advice in The Magic of Thinking Big "Believe Big, "says Schwartz. "The size of your success is determined by the size of your belief. Think little goals and expect little achievements. Think big goals and win big success. Remember this, too! Big ideas and big plans are often easier -- certainly no more difficult - than small ideas and small plans."
