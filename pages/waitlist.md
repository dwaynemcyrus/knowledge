For success in life reading is important.

**Note:** Other than a private conversation with me one-on-one, my newsletter waitlist is the only way to find out when I have available capacity to take on new clients for guidance.

Unlike many who send out newsletters, I’m not looking for numbers, I’m looking to make positive impact and build relationships one person at a time. There is an application process that is manually reviewed by me in order for you to join the waitlist and begin receiving my letters.

Quality over quantity.

My community of Voyagers is not for everyone. It is highly moderated and frequently reviewed to filter out inactive members. I maintain high engagement and encourage you to do the sameEM DASH recovery work is not a solo activity. The space I maintain is founded on privacy, empathy, and trust in order to facilitate conversations that move you towards authentic living. 

**Do not apply** if you are…
- Not ready to invest your time and energy in long-term inner work.
- Looking for someone to fix your life for you and with minimal effort on your part.
- Unwilling to confront difficult emotions and experiences EM DASH your pain.
- Expecting to receive shortcuts and quick fixes to your life’s challenges.
- Not prepared to take the risk, get vulnerable, and  share your story.

Seriously, do not apply if you see yourself in any of the above it will be a waste of both your and my time. 

Now, **if you’re ready** to…
- Heal emotional wounds from trauma and reclaim control over your life.
- Develop emotional resilience and break free from self-sabotaging patterns that no longer serve you.
- Set and maintain functional boundaries in your relationships with yourself and others.
- Be guided and held accountable to living with the intention of honouring your true self.
- Create and work resiliently to bring transformative change to your self, your family, and your community.  

I invite you to apply as I would love to learn more about your story and find ways to help you navigate the challenges of living an extraordinary life as a fellow Voyager.

Your application can take between 2-5 days to be processed as I work through the list manually one at a time.

What to expect once you're in…
- A weekly schedule of letters (Deep Sundays, Inspired Wednesdays, and Friday Reflections), with the occasional extra email.
- Insights on emotional mastery, trauma recovery, and relationship boundaries with direct access to me via email for any comments, questions, and curiosities. 
- Announcements for open mentorship spots, exclusive workshops, and periodic invitations to the private Telegram group.
