@1748
Who am I…

What am I…

Where am I…

When am I…

Why am I…

How am I…

These are the questions that need to be answered, clarified, lived.

@1751
I treat myself as though my life is worthless… 
As though I have nothing to offer the world…
Who I am isn’t worthy of a good life…

It’s all BS and you know it! 

So what is the block?
