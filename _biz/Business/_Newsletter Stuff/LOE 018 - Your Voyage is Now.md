**My Voyager,**

Stop doubting yourself, you know where it is you want to go. 

The thought has been with you in your mind and in your heart. 

Trust it. 

Listen for it.

This has been your direction for life. 

This IS your direction for life, and you know it!

It’s not that you are incapable or that you do not have the time. 

You simply have not set aside the time to exercise the capabilities you posses. 

SET ASIDE THE TIME.

EXERCISE YOUR CAPABILITIES.

This is your voyage. 

This has been the trajectory that you have been craving, and it has been calling on you to embark.

Show yourself the love and respect that is owed to you by you.

One step at a time, 15 minutes a day.

With Gratitude,
*Talha ibn Cyrus*
