## Otter Transcription
So the question always comes up where are all the good men? Interesting. Well, the other question that comes up is, I can't find a good man 

Okay, no problem. Let's address the first issue. The first issue with this, you as a woman do not find men. You may be asking, Well, why? Why don't we find men? Because it's not your role. It's not your job to be out in the world seeking and searching and risking all sorts of destructive relationships on your quest to try and find the man to try and find something you do not know. Is a really silly thing. To do, right? So think about it, ladies. Be honest. You don't know who men are. And those who tell you who men are tend to be other women who don't know who men are. Be it your friends. 

And these the girls you follow on Instagram, movies, TV shows, talk shows, etc. This is where you're getting your information. And 99% of this information is stemmed in zero research because the majority of these women and some men have no idea what they're talking about. Nor have they actually for the women in particular, nor have they actually spoken 

to enough men and to listen and accepted the truth when it's told to them. 

Now that we have an understanding that he was wearing women cannot or cannot. At for you as women that is not in your best interest. To be attempting to hunt for a man is the second point of note that we need to address to ensure that we are on the same page as we move forward into this guide. Ladies. You are the gatekeepers to sex. Men are the gatekeepers to marriage. Now what is the gatekeeper? gatekeeper is one who decides who gets access and or entrance into a place a position a role a person 

okay now, the Greek this hope was very very clear. Ladies, if you decided not to sleep with a man that man does not get sex, which means you are the gatekeeper. Now, when it comes to relationships, if a man doesn't pick you you don't get into a relationship period excellent 

know what's reaffirm something here if you're really if you're in a any form of situation ship, quote unquote 

boyfriend, girlfriend, fiance anything outside of marriage, you're single period. This might actually have to be a whole book on itself. Why? Anything outside of marriage means you're single. Okay, or an article for why this read blah blah blah. Yeah. 

Okay, the next area we need to consider is, well, who do these men pick? Right. If you're saying I don't go out here and find a man. Right? Well how do I make this happen? How do I get married? If I'm not being found? Let's start here with four walls This is men these are the women that marriage good marriage minded been? Pick. Okay. Refer to the podcast where you describe the qualities of a good women are made up for the expectations. Though ladies, we don't want you for the streets. We don't want you to have all this experience. This and that and all the other things listed. We don't want that it's not attractive to us. Okay, your money means nothing your career is irrelevant. Your education 

now let's have an understanding of who the men look for 

when they are ready to find a wife. Let's deal with the mill. With this photo with its fundamentals in place. Let's deal with the core issue for a lot of you women. 

are Muslim sisters, traditional women, good women who are preserving yourself from all of the toxic of the outside world many of you if not all, the overwhelming majority are home buddies. Home buddies. See you do all the right things you take care of yourself. 

You eat well. You work out you stretch. You're mindful of your mind your body, your mental health. You do the right things. Yes. You were raised and trained to be a wife. A lot. However, part of you preserving yourself is that you keep to the indoors. Your home is your castle. This is your comfort. It is your safe space. 

If I had very little interest in galavanting, venturing outside without purpose, intent and of course the right people around to keep you safe. This issue is big 

the core issue is this right? You marriage minded women our whole bodies. You are not meant to go and find a man. 

So you're at a loss as to how to get this is the guide for you. This is what this is the place this is where we will outline 

the steps needed and that you must take in order to severely or greatly improve your odds of being known. When a man especially the type of man that you would like is ready for marriage. 

Alright, let's begin. First and foremost, ladies. The other thing that we need to understand is this is marriage. Right? 

The desire to have a good man. We're not talking about a rich man. We're not talking about this of great status. We're talking about a good man. A man who will honor you respect you provide for you protect you profess to you. He's a good man, a man who will lead you this household of standards for the family and do everything in his power. To keep all of you safe and in line and protected. Talking about good men your every day. Good man 

is getting married is not just leave it to God. Stop this. Ask yourself. When was the last time God gave you something that you didn't begin to put the work in that you didn't put working on yourself on yourself? A weight 

so, when you want a good man similar to when you were seeking out a good education or a good career, you had to do what research you had to invest because the only way to have a good investment is to invest time into receiving that good investment or attaining. Marriage is no different ladies, men are no different. It is to your benefits for you 

to invest you need to think of finding a man as an investment, not something that will just magically show up. But a guy who will just happen to show up at your door randomly and ask your head for marriage. And he's everything is all the things that you're that you need. Not necessarily what you're looking for, but that you need ladies 

and a few of the things that you want. Doesn't work that way, ladies, it's a fairy tale to think otherwise. 

Good. So I believe we now have some core understandings and baseline information put together in order for us to move forward. So now we begin. What are the steps to positioning myself to be found? 

That's what you're looking for ladies. You want to be found. To make it more relevant. You want to need to be picked by men. 

But it's a side note you might want to do a little section on what it picked me is and the true pygmies etc, etc. Ladies, you want to be picked. This is the whole goal of marriage, right? Because men are the gatekeepers to relationships. So we need to pick you so you as a woman need to get picked. But how do we get picked from a homebody? I don't leave my house. I barely leave my house for the necessities. That here ladies, this is going to require a lot of investment. Yes, investment for a man. Oh my gosh, some of you are freaking out. I have to invest. Of course if you want something good, you invest in things right. Marriage is an investment because it's an investment and you want to make good investment. It requires you to put the work up front. This is your work up front ladies. This is it 

so first and foremost 

you want to have an idea, my dears have the type of lifestyle that you want to have 

that whatever you want is best for you. However, we're going to encourage you ladies to be pragmatic, be realistic. Be realistic, what sort of community are a part of what are the people around you? How do they live? Because we are as human beings we don't tend to stray too far outside of our communities. Rain where we naturally are in life. There was a reason to think about the type of life that you want, right? Think about it ladies. You have your family if your husband what does this look like? Really think about it. Get excited about it. Enjoy this process 

the next stage release is to now think okay, well what is the type of man or who is the type of event that's going to be able to provide this for some of you be thinking provide what I provide for myself. Well, if that's you, this book is not free. 

It's not free so this part is going to be this part is going to be a bit more difficulties. You're gonna have to pull up the Google. You have to be in to learn more about men, right? What's their job does he have what does that job pay? For where it is I want to live what's the average salary? What does it cost to live here to the job? What's the most common jobs can these jobs facilitate the life that they want? 

Yeah. Ladies it's always best for you to be modest and realistic. 

In your desires, and expectations are always your best. Now, once you have once you know have an idea of those kinds of life, you want to have your husband 

you've identified you've written out every description of who this man is you'd like to marry. Right? 

When I say this, I'm talking about Jared looking into what sort of hobbies he has interests. What are the concerns that he has in life? What is he trying to do?

What are the joys he has life? Right hobbies? Who is this man? Feel free to give him a name. Write write a nice little bio. Also look of what does this typical day look like? What does he do? Where does he go? Considered thinking about his typical week. Again, where does he go? What does he do? Is he involved in anything? The volunteer does he work? Two and three jobs. really explore who the man is. That's going to be able to give you the lifestyle that you want. 

See ya have the information about the man is where he goes, what do you do? What does he do? How does he spend his days what sort of people are they are here around is here out? Right? 

There's information here ladies This is meant to help you position yourself. Okay. So the issue that comes up when men are ready to marry is this 

that we are ready and we are seeking that's what we're supposed to do ladies we seek. We search. We tend to go by word of mouth. Right? We ask the people around us. Do you know somebody? I'm looking. Do you have any recommendations? Any suggestions? 

And if your name doesn't come up in the spaces that Batman ventures into you, you're never going to get that man because he doesn't know you exist s

o now you may be asking, Well, how do I let them know I exist, by the way, do you again am a homebody they don't go out to brunch places. 

It's not my thing. What do I do? How do I fix this? Who want to get married? The problem again ladies you're in the right spot that nearly an hour they go. 

Okay, cool. So ladies, Cornwallis now is to get an understanding of where this man goes. What sort of people he interacts with. Because your work is this. You need to make yourself known to the women right to the women of the back of those communities. Need to is very necessary. Remember when men are searching we start and we fork and we leverage what our network the people that we know to help introduce us to available women for marriage. You need your name to come up. Somebody needs to mention you. Some of you guys were like well, I don't want to go to these places. Right? I want to make sure to preserve myself and protect my modesty. Etc. It's no problem. No problem. With tears you still go to work or school or the grocery store. Or you know every now and then we do hang out with your girlfriends. You ladies do venture outside and you do it in ways that are respectful. 

You can do the same thing here. Go to these communities, right? Go to sort of their events. 

Join some of their groups in discord or wherever and begin to interact with the women of that community. Let them get to know who you are. You want to build good rapport with them. In turn, what do you also let her know off the bat actually that you know your sister and you're looking for marriage. You're good for men and looking for marriage. 

And you ask these women to keep their eye out for you and or to make any suggestions. Can you do this and every single community that you have researched of where that man goes who he described earlier? Where does he go? What does he do? Who does he hang around with? 

Because men make this their investments and they themselves invest their time should probably do a section of where you're not going to find your husband. Nick could find his husband in bars and clubs. That there are places where the investment is very, very low. And therefore the reward reward is very very low.

Ladies, so how is it that you get in touch with some of these sisters say Trent is online? Primarily Well of course you attend the events. Writing the show face that's always the best way to do it always. The other aspect is this. You begin to connect online through email, DMS. However it is we can do however it is you have to do it you begin to reach out these sisters 

key here because it's networking said you want to give more than you give more. So I would hope that for some of you ladies who are interested in this way you are also attempting to make genuine connections, these interests right You're not just trying to use them for their network as well. Please believe that maybe you are I don't know. 

Right. So over it's why the press it's in your best interest to get to know these ladies and to build rapport because they're going to be making recommendations on your behalf right they should be able to speak well of you have a decently good understanding of your characters, your values your morals. 

You've done this right and you're letting yourself be known amongst these women, the community this is what will happen 

when the men are searching and they begin to talk to their boys, right. Maybe even some of the women that they know, they're gonna say hey, you know, we need to get married now I'm looking. What you want is for your UTV so well known and appreciated and liked and these spaces, especially by the women of these spaces, that your name will come up. Right as we know women dominate the social sphere. So if you want anything to spread, you let women know. So this is why it's important for you to get to know the women get to know them. They will be and as you guys know you know, news spreads quickly amongst women very, very quick. 

So you want to leverage that brainless? 

Morning.
