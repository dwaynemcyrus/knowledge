Ya Rabb I am becoming like the men I speak on, the ones who are weak and not honourable or righteous. 

I am struggling. 

Why do I fight myself like this? Why do I fight you? 

I know what I need and what I need to do. I can write it all here and now. 

So why don’t you?

Because I am afraid of accepting the truth that what I want and desire is possible and that I can take full control over my life with Allah SWT guidance. Deeper still, the reality that all I need to do is focus on what I want and everything will be solved for me.

I just need to focus on the action items that prioritize that greatest benefit and change to my life.
