A male survivor with the hands of an artist who thinks like a designer and loves like no other. Community builder, born storyteller, and outspoken creative with a very unique perspective on the social interactions of humans as one with a neurodivergent mind. As one of my core strengths I truly enjoy the journey of learning new things while feverishly following my curiosities and feeding them with lots of expirements. 

  

BTW As Salam Alaikum, and I am extremely thankful that my interests compliment each other so well.
