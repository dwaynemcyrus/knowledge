Story 
- Height of the drama preview: That was my thought after completing a call with a friend desperately trying to detach herself from a guy who clearly wasn’t ready for her. 

 What started as a simple curiosity and Q&A about men turned into a series of call navigating her emotions and gently shedding the harsh lifht of reality onto her situationship.

It was our third or fourth call and little did I realize I was coaching her through an eventual breakup. 

She was ready. He was not. Making things worse he would ghost  her regularly with little explanation. 

A complete lack of respect for her.

He was taking her for a ride while she was investing her emotions and time.

An extremely brave woman who stood with me in the painful truth of who this man was. Tears were shed, feelings hurt, and knowledge was gained.

She began to value herself again and took the steps to stand in her truth and love herself.

After a few more similar calls from other women I understood how to do for them what I couldn’t for my older sisters growing up.

This began a the genesis of The Delivery Pod a place to educate and help amazing/good women navigate the challenges or dangers of engaging with a man.

She did it for Love

Growing up I watched my sisters destroy themselves, mind and body for love repeatedly, and I couldn’t stop them.

That was my thought after completing a call with a friend desperately trying to detach herself from a guy who clearly wasn’t ready for her.

What started as simple curiosity, a Q&A about men turned into a series of calls dedicated to navigating her emotions and gently shedding a harsh light of reality onto her "situation-ship".

It was our third or fourth call and little did I realize that I was guiding her through an eventual breakup.

She was ready for commitment. **He was not.**

Making things worse, he would ghost her regularly with little explanation.

A complete lack of respect.

He was taking her for a ride while she was investing her emotions and time.

After a few calls an extremely brave woman stood with me in the painful truth of her reality. Tears were shed, feelings hurt, and knowledge was gained. She began to value herself again and took the steps to stand in truth and love herself.

I was recommended to speak to a few other women about their struggles with men and I clearly understood how to do for them what I couldn’t for my older sisters growing up.

This began what I now call The Delivery Pod, a place to educate and help good women navigate the challenges of engaging with a man to foster a healthy relationship.
