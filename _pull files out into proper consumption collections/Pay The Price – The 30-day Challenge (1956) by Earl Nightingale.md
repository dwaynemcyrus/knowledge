> *"Ask, and it shall be given you; seek, and ye shall find; knock, and it shall be opened unto you: For everyone that asketh receiveth; and he that seeketh findeth; and to him that knocketh it shall be opened."*
## The 30 Day Overview
1. Emotionally and intellectually, we become what we think about and as we sow, we shall reap.
2. Free yourself from limitations, allowing your mind to soar knowing that our only restrictions are those we place upon ourselves in today's world of immense opportunities.
3. Exercise courage and maintain a positive outlook on all personal challenges, set clear and definite goals, explore all possibilities, employ your imagination, and persist against all odds, acting promptly and decisively when the path forward is clear.
4. Make it a habit to save at least 10% of your earnings. And remember, regardless of your current job, it holds vast potential if you're prepared to pay the price.
5. Act on your goals and your ideas, for without action, ideas remain worthless.
6. On one side of the card, write your goal, whatever it may be. On the other side, inscribe the words we've quoted from The Sermon on the Mount: *"Ask, and it shall be given you; seek, and ye shall find; knock, and it shall be opened unto you."*
## The price for a fulfilling life:
1. Understanding that your thoughts shape your reality.
2. Embracing the power of imagination and allowing your mind to explore possibilities.
3. Exercising courage to focus on your goals daily.
4. Saving a portion of your earnings.
5. Acting on your ideas, for without action, ideas remain worthless.
## Rules of the Road
- Should you falter during your first 30 days, meaning if you find yourself suddenly overwhelmed by negative thoughts, you must start over from that point and complete another 30 days.
- You have nothing to lose by embarking on this test and everything to gain
- Carry the goal card with you, referring to it throughout the day, before you sleep at night, and when you wake at night. 
- While thinking about your goal, realise that soon it will be yours. In fact, it is essentially yours the moment you wrote it down and begin to think about it.
- Observe the abundance around you as you go about your daily activities. You have as much right to this abundance as any other living being. It's yours for the asking.
- Cease focusing on what you fear. Each time a fearful or negative thought enters your consciousness, replace it with a mental image of your positive and worthwhile goal.
- You must take control of your mind. It will only think about what you allow it to think about.
- Go beyond what you are obliged to do. Maintain a cheerful, positive outlook, give more of yourself than you have ever done before. Do this with the understanding that your returns in life must be in direct proportion to what you give.
- The moment you decide on a goal to work towards, you become a successful person, you belong to the top five percent.
- Do not overly concern yourself with how you will achieve your goal. Leave that entirely to a power greater than yourself. All you need to do is know where you are going.
- Be persistent, you are demonstrating faith. Persistence is simply another word for faith. If you lacked faith, you would not persevere.
- During your spare time in this test period, engage with books that will support and elevate you. Inspirational works such as the Bible, Dorothea Brande's "Wake Up and Live", "The Magic of Believing" by Claude Bristol, and Napoleon Hill's "Think and Grow Rich".
- Refrain from worrying. Worry breeds fear, and fear is paralysing.
- Remain calm and cheerful. Do not let minor annoyances distract or deter you.
- Be of service. Success is not about making money; making money is a byproduct of success, and success comes from providing valuable service. Success must precede earnings. We must offer service before expecting financial return.
- Do not fixate on the money. Focus on providing service, building, dreaming, and creating.
- Remember that your success will be measured by the quality and quantity of service you render, with money serving as a yardstick for measuring this service.
- Listen to the record frequently day and night, maybe even midday.
- Stop thinking of all the reasons why you cannot be successful and instead think of all the reasons why you can.
- Quit running yourself down.
- Trace your attitudes back through your childhood and try to discover where you first got the idea you couldn’t be a success if that’s the way you’ve been thinking.
- Change the image you have of yourself by writing out a description of the person you would like to be. 
- Act the part of the successful person you have decided to become.

## Six steps that will aid you in realising success:
The physician who provided these insights is the well-regarded West Coast psychiatrist [[Dr. David Harold Fink]].
1. Set yourself a definite goal.
2. Cease belittling yourself.
3. Stop contemplating all the reasons why you cannot be successful and instead focus on all the reasons why you can.
4. Examine your attitudes back through your childhood and endeavour to ascertain where you first developed the belief that you couldn't achieve success if that is your current mindset.
5. Alter the image you have of yourself by composing a description of the person you aspire to be.
6. Embody the characteristics of the successful individual you have resolved to become.
