## The Response
Open: The Pen

68:27 I don’t know who we is, but I can assure you that I know I have been depriving myself even with all of the blessings and provisions you provide. But please feed me Allah SWT, I need this…

68:21-33 I read so more and understood something about a garden and people being ungrateful and greedy with their blessings…this is me no. I am. Ot spending my wealth in service of Allah SWT, I forget money is not the only form of wealth. I don’t think I really understand the message though…

  

You need to read this entire Surah.

  

First: Crouching

45:16 Just Like the yesterdays I’m certain. Do you not see that Allah SWT gives you! Yet. You doubt Allah SWT when you need it and are going to do works in service which is far better than the nothing you produce now.

45:13-19 You know the way to behave. So do it! You are protected and you need to stop the sabotage! Stop it now! STAND UP!

  

Second: The Consolation 

94:7 Wow… right after I wrote “STAND UP!” So where do I go from here, I have duties to fulfill and that is providing for your family. WORK!

94:Surah Allah SWT has given you ease and will give you more, but you must work, and once you have received the ease you seek, run to Allah SWT and be grateful. Your path is like the Prophet, but you need to accept. This is your way. 

  

Third: The Hypocrits

63:9 You are in your test remember Allah SWT told you Wife and Children…Hold on tighter to your salat and Qur’an. 

63:1-12 You just spoke about you not spending the wealth Allah SWT has given you and then Allah SWT give your the verse to read (10). Sigh…you have to do this! You need to show up!!! Remember your duties, HUSBAND, FATHER. 

  

Close: The Dunes

46:3 Your time is short…you cannot waste anymore time at all! No more wasting of time my friend…none. Just like my Dad, Cyrus will be my name in these streets. We launch the business today, now! 

46:1-7 Get yourself in order…it’s you believe or you do not believe and I know I do, so behave like it! There will be no success for you if this part of you doesn’t change. You are trying to envoke some kind of money to save you when the only saviour is your submission and obedience to Allah SWT and by his mercy and grace you will receive benefit. 

  

It’s time for Jihad.

  

  

It is time for me to decide and show Allah SWT that I am one who will obey and no longer feed and idolize self pity, fear, and the ideas of unworthiness. It is disrespectful. I have been chosen, I am now to be back on path…I had it these past 3 years off and on. It’s time to be get on it permanently, DO NOT be a hypocrite. You are doing this business out to care for your family and of the Ummah.

  

Thank you Allah for such a noble path to walk.
