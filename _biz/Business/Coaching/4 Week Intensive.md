Given the considerations for single-session coaching pricing and the specialized nature of your 4-week intensive program focusing on Islamic wisdom, personal development, and trauma recovery, pricing the intensive requires balancing the value provided with accessibility for your target audience. Here's a suggested approach:

  

### Pricing Factors for the Intensive:

- **Comprehensiveness**: The intensive is more structured and comprehensive than a single session, offering deeper transformation.

- **Inclusion of Materials**: Assume the program includes personalized materials, exercises, and possibly access to additional resources or a community forum.

- **Limited Availability**: The nature of an intensive means you might have limited slots, adding to its exclusivity and value.

  

### Suggested Pricing Strategy:

  

1. **Calculate Total Contact Hours**: If your intensive includes 1-hour weekly live sessions, plus an estimated additional hour per week of personalized feedback or interaction, that’s 8 hours of direct contact over 4 weeks.

  

2. **Add Value of Materials and Access**: Consider the creation and use of any materials or access to platforms. This adds value beyond the direct coaching hours.

  

3. **Benchmark Against Market Rates**: Given the range for single sessions ($150-$200 per hour), and the added value of a comprehensive program, packaging this as a premium offering is justified.

  

### Suggested Price Point:

- **Base Price**: Considering the factors above, a base price for the 4-week intensive could range from **$1,200 to $1,600**. This aligns with the market rates for specialized coaching while acknowledging the additional value of a structured program with materials and possibly limited group interaction.

  

### Additional Considerations:

- **Early Bird or Launch Discount**: Offering an initial discount to early registrants or during the launch phase can incentivize sign-ups. For example, a 10-15% discount off the base price.

- **Payment Plans**: To increase accessibility, consider offering a payment plan, such as two payments of $600-$800, depending on the final price.

- **Scholarship Slots or Sliding Scale**: Having one or two slots available at a reduced rate can make the program more accessible to those in financial need, aligning with the inclusive values of your brand.

  

This pricing reflects the intensive’s comprehensive nature and specialized focus, positioning it as a premium offering in the coaching market. Adjustments might be needed based on client feedback, actual costs incurred, and the perceived value of the program.
