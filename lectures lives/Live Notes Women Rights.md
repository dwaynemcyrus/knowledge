The Solution

- We are going to go over the rights of women within Islam based on the various social roles in society

“if she is a wife, she is life partner, if she is as a mother, the paradise is under the feet of mother, if she is daughter it is blessing of Almighty Allah”

Mothers

- Sons are meant to give support to their mothers if the husband is not, but only if he is able to and can afford it, preventing any need for mothers to be placed in elderly care

- Even if the son leaves Islam he is still meant to treat his mother well and care for her if needed and possible

Wives

- Meant to be treated with kindness, it is said that the best of men are the men who treat their women well

- To afford maintenance is not only legally approved but also it is an act of devotion (ibadat). Under Muslim law, maintenance is due to the wife from the husband as a recompense for the matrimonial restraint and is one of the necessary and inherent conditions of the marriage contract

- Maintenance is a duty...such a duty that must be discharged cheerfully without any censure, hurt or patronization (65:7)

- In divorce there an iddat period in which the husband is still responsible for her maintenance

- slam does not impose liability upon the wife to bear expenses of the family or to bear expenses of her husband on any condition

- Rights of residence - A woman has freedom to choose residence for herself. In Islam, as it is the liability of husband to provide proper maintenance to his wife, a married woman must stay to her husband’s place of residence. Considering the ability and benefit of her husband a married woman can select her residence in such place as dignity of the family is properly maintained. According to the direction of Islam she cannot claim her residence in such place which will be some hardship for her husband.
