## Phase 01
### Council of Men
The Council must remain a seat of 9 and each member has a biography that is documents and can be referenced and studied for guidance.

* Unapologetic
* Belief/Faith

His work is just unmistakeable no matter what piece you see, you know it is him! Speaking in his own experiences of the world as a black man, it's haunting and beautiful at the same time. His work is an expression of his own experiences as a “black” man in America, making use of various mediums to tell his story in neo-expressionism.

**Values:**
* Creative
* Explorative
* Expressive
* Honest
* Indelible
* Rebellious
* Revealing
* Unmistakable
* Vulnerable
#### Bansky (Robin Gunningham?)
His work is influential, he creates to speak on world issues! If he needs to destroy a work to make it speak louder he does so without hesitation. Simply makes more and gets it down. He operates in his own lane, seemingly competing with no one but himself.
His work is rebellious and unapologetic. Creating to speak, holding no emotional ties to anything he produces as he just creates more. The sole purpose is for his art to say something loudly and to as many people as possible.

* Honest
* Indelible
* Influential
* Provoking

* Courageous
* Honest
* Influential
* Intelligent
* Provoking
* Rebellious
* Self-Respect
* Unapologetic

A refined man of honour, intelligence, and duty! Highly responsible for the content he creates and takes a complete unapologetic stance for the black male image and betterment. A role model for “black” men, who has spent time addressing the issues we face navigating the challenges of becoming successful men.

**Values:** 
* Consistent
* Disciplined
* Honor
* Influential
* Intelligent
