## No.1 Do not impersonate Tate.

You are not allowed to have it so that when people DM or interact with you, you use the word "I".

You are not Tate and you are not allowed to put words in his mouth.

I do not require you to tell the world you aren't Tate, but if there is a single DM message or comment where you reply as Tate.

Where you pretend to be him,

You will be banned.

## No.2 Do not post things that represent the Tate Brand in a negative way

We lost our payment processor and have the entire world and all the social media platforms attacking Tate because a few affiliates decided to clip up the most provocative clips possible.

Before you post, ask yourself, would Tate approve of this being posted?

## No.3 DO NOT SCAM PEOPLE

Do not sell anything using The Tate persona or brand that is not personally approved by Tate himself.

ANYTHING ELSE, is considered a Scam.
