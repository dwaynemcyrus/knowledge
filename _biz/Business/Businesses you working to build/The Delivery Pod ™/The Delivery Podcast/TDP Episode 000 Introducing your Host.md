## Script
Welcome to the The Delivery, a podcast dedicated to helping women navigate relationships with men. 

I’m your host Cyrus and I will be your guide through the world of courtship. The intent here is to get good women with good men by educating our women on who men are, what we function, and how to work with us. 

Here the basis of how i see relationships being built...

Here's some quick insight into my philosophy around relationships. First my saying that hold to as the basis of developing any relation, "Communication builds trust, and trust builds relationships." Second the pillars that create and maintain all functioning relationship: 

This podcast speaks to women who are seeking marriage and are ready to learn and do the hard work to get it. There will be hard truths and i reassure you that I will be as gentle as possible in my delivery without sacrificing the truth. 

If this isn't you it is best for you to tune out, this is a place for good women to improve their understanding of good men. Traditional values are not negotiable here.

~~All information will presented in the most gentle of ways without compromising and harsh truths, there will be many.~~ Unless explicitly stated everything mentioned is rooted in observable reality and common sense about what gets results.

Before I leave you with some more clips from our weekly live discussions *Safe Space Sessions* let me give you a breakdown of what to expect. 
- Questions and answers about who men are and how we function, yes the hard truth
- Story-time commentary on how to handle various situations and issues in relationships
- And of course education on men, our current dating environment, and how to minimize the trauma of improper courtship. 

Our first episode will begin with addressing a delusion many women carry, [[TDP Episode 001 Men Are Not Like Women|Men and Women are Not the Same]] about themselves. 

Here’s a taste of how I, Cyrus, your ever patient host delivers the truth. 

Enjoy.
