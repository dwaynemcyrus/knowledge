**fill in that which you intend to do**

O Allah! In Your Knowledge if this action is bad for me, bad for my religion and faith, for my life and end death, for here in this world and the hereafter then turn it away from me and turn me away from it and whatever is better for me, ordain destine that for me and then make me satisfied with it."*
