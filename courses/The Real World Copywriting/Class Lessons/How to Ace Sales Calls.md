## Summary

## Notes
### Trust, Belief, and Desperation
- **Sales is the transference of belief over a bridge of trust**
- During a sales call you need to establish trust and convey the belief (your certainty in yourself, your solutions, and the outcomes you can create)
- Establishing trust and belief is key to your sales call and you must always **begin with getting to know them as a human being**, you must spend the first 5 minutes at minimum doing this
- If you feel off about this person while getting to know them, just cut it off and move on, there's nothing wrong with that
- **Desperation kills the building of trust**, and as humans we have evolved to avoid these people because there is something wrong with them and we do not want them to infect us, similar to a person panicking in water trying not to drown, they tend to drag the one saving them under 
- The way to avoid desperation is to have a full pipeline and believe in what it is that you are doing
- **Build trust by being honest and clear, authorize**
### The "Doctor" Frame for Sales
"____Perscription without __diagnosis_ is malpractice"This question is required.
- When conducting your sales calls, **you are not a copywriter offering your services you are a doctor examining them for problems** to which you will prescribe solutions
- The frame is meant to keep you from falling into commodity and keeping you as an authority and an expert in what you do
- You cannot avoid the first step and just start prescribing email marketing, the patient now has no reason to listen or believe you. **Have a hypothesis (or a few), but never offer a solution without first diagnosing**
- It's important to subscribe a solution to their problems only after you have diagnosed their problems
### Using "SPIN" Questions
- This is how we diagnose the patient using SPIN, and in these calls your area marketing consultant
- You want to find out what marketing they are doing, the dream state, the current problems, and know their goals in terms of goals (revenue, products, etc)
- Situation questions. Problem questions. Implication questions. Needs Payoff questions 
- Your sales in this call is question-based! Remember you are the doctor
#### Situation 
- Current marketing
- Customers they have
- Email list size, etc
- What would you like your business to look like the dream
- What would you like your online marketing to be like
- You will often find a gap between where they are and where they want to be, they are going to live 
- 
#### Problem Questions
- What have you done in past with your marketing
- What have you found successful in your marketing 
- What have you found unsuccesful in your marketing?
- What do you find is holding you back
- What have tried before that didn't work
- They make overlook these things, and you may need to make some suggestions
- Be sure to amplify the pain a little bit in this phase
#### Implication Questions
- The goal here is to identify the problems
- What happens if you never solve the selling problem
- What happens if you did solve you email problem?
- What would happen if you sent out more emails?
#### Needs/Payoff Questions
- Once you identify the key implication (problem) ask What would this mean to you if you solved this problem, they may say it's an extra 5 million dollar increase this year, this helps you price your service moving forward
	- the needs vs pay off question allows you to quantify and price accordingly
- Once you have identified the needs vs payoff questions you can begin to diagnos the problem
- You want to lay out the entire journey step by step to go from where the are now to the dream state
- Using these questions allows to diagnos the patient and provide the big solution for them, the solution may require months of work and you want to lay out the journey to show them the amount of work it actually takes to do this
- You don't want to pitch the massive journey, instead you want to do a smaller Discovery project and pitch that
### Discovery Projects
- Now that you know where they need to go you want to pitch them a project for the very first step of the larger journey you expressed to them
- Get very familiar with marketing terms, the ladder, email marketing, upselling products, etc.
- Remember all things are a trade of value over time and attention, requesting a 3k month retainer for the next year is a big [[delta]] (what does the mean?) to jump to, a big trade of time and money relative to where you are
- Discovery Projects its meant to build a relationship with new prospect, to evaluate each other working together, to see and to show your skill in what you do
- Start with a discovery project and explain it like this....
	1.  Instead of doing a big retainer lets go with a smaller project that starts with the first steps of the greater plan
	2.  lets do a project where you send 5 email to specific segment of your list to promote your $297 course
	3. this will be a smaller project and will give us an opportunity to evaluate each other, make sure were a good fit in working together to achieve your goals. I normally do a retainer, we'll start small and use this asa bench mark for future business
	4. Now SHUT YOUR MOUTH
	5. They will ask what will it cost for those 5 email, and you will give them the cost (700+), the pricing will be discussed in a future video
- Keep in mind discovery isn't a discount project, its a smaller scope of a project (the first few steps of the bigger plan), it's meant to be quick and easy win for you and them
- **Once money changes hands they will take you more seriously**, respond to your emails, be more involved because they are now invested
- Once you have been paid once, they are more likely to pay you again once you do your part which is them evaluating your skill

### How to Price your Services and Collect Money
- You are not in this to make average money, you are in this to make BIG money
- You want to charge based on the % of the value that you bring, this is where you need to be
- Do the math on how much this deliverable will bring in. Based on list size, cost of the product, average email open rate, the average click-through on the email, and average buy rate on the sales page you can do the math on these numbers
- Say your value is 15k and you say I'm contributing 20% to these sales (them setting up the sales page, etc), you are at $3k, this may be a bit tough for them to swallow at first as 700 is easier, but if the math checks out then you go with the 3K from 15K
- Email contributions are typically 15% and sales pages are typically 30% contribution
- The benefit of working for yourself is that you are paid on the negotiations you can create, which is based on the belief you can instill and the value you actually produce
#### Reducing Risks and Guarantees 
- You can get paid in full upfront, all the risk on them
- You can get paid half up front and at the end, its a shared risk and very common
- You can get paid at the end of the project, all the risk is on you they can not pay you
- Complete the Revshare deal, give me access to your analytics, and pay me 10% of what I make for you, this is highly not recommended by the teacher unless you have extreme trust with the person you are working with. This only makes sense when this has been a long-term client. Rev shares are where you make your serious money on the back end.
- Guarantee can be if I don't make XYZ results I can offer a money back, etc. **You should not have to do this as you should know how to do your work**
- **Avoid PayPal**, they can hold your money and make reverse requests
- Stripe is a good source, direct payments to banks, e-transfers, crypto (good for international), venmo, zel? It all depends on what is convenient for you and your clients.

## What to do when they say "Yes"?
After setting up the discovery project…
1. Research by asking the client questions, testimonials, goals, target market, etc. You want to have hours of research done
2. Write the first draft of the sequence for example and send to them for review
3. Once in the review process you go back and forth to refine it
4. Publishing is either done by you are your client’s team
5. The project goes live and you get results tons of results 
6. Next you move them up your value ladder to the next stage of products/service

### How to Practice and get Good at your Sales
- Sales is an important skill that will help you throughout the rest of your life
- You get good at sales through practice just get on sales calls, after a few times you get more comfortable
- A good way to prep is to plan out your questions prior to a call, also map out a conversation tree, and you can roleplay this 
- If possible record your sales calls via Zoom to watch later and improve by taking notes
- Research the company and business prior to the call which is good prep
- Once you learn the skill it becomes very natural to do 
### Bonus - Discovery Call Breakdown and Review

- Be sure to always set a time for the call be a professional 
- **When you first speak with someone dedicate time to learn about them, get them speaking**
- **Personal questions to ask, where in the world are you, how’s your day going, etc**
- Never dive right into the business, it’s subconsciously tells the prospect you don’t care about them as a person
- **People do business with who they Know like and trust in that order**
- Don't talk tactics first (what you doing with marketing), start with knowing their customer, their business, etc
- **Be sure to ask many situation questions, what products are you pushing, who have you been trying to reach out to, etc.**
- **When asked what do you do? I’m a marketing consultant working with businesses like your to get xyz outcomes**

- **Frame your discovery projects as tests to work with their clients to learn more about their customers, it positions you as a pro, and not to a win/win regardless of if the test is highly successful or not because it’s about gaining insights from their customers** 
- Come up with other parts of the funnel to service outside of the immediate thoughts to stand out
- Always think strategically, and listen to your clients, this makes you stand you massively 
- **Always negotiate mitigating their risks**
- *"I’m relatively new to your industry, which is why I’m working out smaller projects to better familiarize myself"*

- **Never lie about your experience** 
- Read *How to make Friends and Influence People*
- It’s not about quantity of clients, it’s about the quality of clients to reach 50k/month, you will typically only have 3-4 clients at a time unless you go the agency route
- **When you learn you can’t help a client immediately let them know you won’t be a fit and would not be able** 
- Ask *"How long you been doing this, what impact do you want to have in the world?"* 
- You want a 50% positive reply and affirmation to getting on a call after free value to work together
- **If a prospect doesn’t have an email list than you need to change your free value to signup page from email chain**
