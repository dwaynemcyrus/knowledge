## Summary
  
## Highlights
- Zettelkasten means slip-box in German which was invented by the German socioligist Nicholas ???
- There are 3 types of notes
	- Fleeting notes: idea, thoughts, they are meant to be temporary captures
	- Literature notes: Are your understanding from a source material that is concise, it's essentially a summary of your own understanding
	- Permanent notes: Is a single idea that would live on a card and is easy to understand in isolation, it does not require any additional material. It is your understanding, in your words.
- The purpose is to build up these permanent notes and link them together.
- When you bring notes together you create the opportunity to create new insights. These new insights allow you to create new content and to ask questions against your slip-box.
- A little bit a day compounds over time
- Build a wealth of knowledge that an help other people.
