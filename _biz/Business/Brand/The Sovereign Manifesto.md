### Definition of a Manifesto
A manifesto is a public declaration of the beliefs, intentions, motives, or policies of an individual, group, or organization. It typically outlines a specific vision or set of goals, often in a political, social, or artistic context. The purpose of a manifesto is to communicate ideas and inspire action, sometimes calling for change or outlining a new direction.

Manifestos are often associated with political movements or parties, where they serve as a statement of principles or plans. For example, The Communist Manifesto by Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels is one of the most famous examples, outlining the goals and ideology of the communist movement. However, manifestos can also be used in other contexts, such as by artists, activists, or organizations to articulate their vision and rally support.
### My Writings Draft
#### Societal Change
Challenging and changing the narrative around male trauma survivors, especially in the black community.

To be a beacon of hope and transformation for men worldwide, enabling them to lead sovereign lives marked by emotional freedom, purposeful living, and profound personal fulfillment.

The creation of a new breed of Black Men living a life on purpose, healed, and embracing the values and morals of the righteous guided by my transmission of Islamic teachings. These men have undergone their Rights of Passage and this is repeated and done with every son and daughter born to these men as our new norm. A community and full suite/archive of knowledge and training is available for all boys/men online of free access to help them develop.

The false idea of men not being victims has been changed on the societal and in-turn legal levels. Black women are no longer holding onto the false narratives of black men in particular as a group. A clear distinction has been made between the responsible and the irresponsible of the men. Mental health and emotional development are now prioritized and highly encouraged and valued amongst men between men.

These boys and men are known as, Sovereign Voyagers leaving their mark on the world as their legacy. Because of my works these men are equipped and trained to live righteously protecting and maintaining their families and/or communities in brotherhood. My name is etched in history permanently as a true leader and guidance for black men and in-turn women and children.
