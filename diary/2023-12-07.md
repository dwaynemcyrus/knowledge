Istikarah
I don’t know what I need but you do and all that is coming to me is about earning halal money online to take care of the family in a self-sustaining and self-reliant manner, no boss no client (you know what I mean).

Open
92:12 I am glad I’m in the right place seeking guidance at the right time Alhamdulillah 

First
96:19 Submit myself to Allah and yea I have made Istikarah around these things a number of time and have not followed through

Second
96:7 I have been operating as though you are not my guide and that you are not the one who provides all. 

Third 
112:2 Put trust and faith into Allah SWT for your safety and provision

Close
102:5 Perhaps my certainty can only come from my faith in Allah SWT to provide


Reflection 
This feels better I’m glad I made Istikarah, I am still being guided and I need to do it by reading previous Istikarah
