Leading my life and in turn my family by seeking out you Allah and then seeking out my provisions and sovereignty by doing the work I have been avoiding: creating content, mentoring men, holding lives, creating art; all together speaking my voice.

The Most High
87:14 I started by purifying myself. I have shaven, asked for forgiveness, had a funeral for my old self, and returned to Salat. But I know I must continue to purify daily.

The Calamity
101:8 A warning about the deeds I am not doing, the work I have been avoiding.
101:Surah A stern reminder of the hardship that comes your way from not do by the work Allah SWT has given you to do…LEAD THE PEOPLE.

Muhammad 
47:4 You are at war. This is truth. Against yourself and those who want to corrupt you and yours. This is YOUR TEST from Allah SWT. 
47:1-12 You must fight, this is your belief in practice and Allah SWT protects the believers and plants them firmly. Fight, fight today! FIGHT NOW.

I have been commanded by the God, the Creator, the One to fight my fight. To stop hiding, running, doubting, Allah SWT is your provider, protector. You are being placed to be rooted , but you must fight to plant your feet and Allah will do the rest.
