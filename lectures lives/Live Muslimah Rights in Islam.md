Banner: "Muslim Women Have No Rights They Are Oppressed"

The Problem
- Too many women are not being educated on their rights and are being given cultural practices to follow instead
- Women who are interested in Islam are fearful because of the propaganda that women are harmed and it is permissable in Islam

Quick History
Prior to the revelation of Islam throught the Prrophet Mohammed the pagan Arabs treated women horribly. 
- Burying female children
- Forcing women to dance naked
- Women had no rights, dignity, or honour
- Women were treeated as slaves to be used for sexual desires
- Womens positions in society were worse then animals in many cases
- Other forms of inhuman and discriminatory acts

Unlike other religions women in Islam are not seen as having inherent sin, and wicked ways, where the men to be seen as noble and honourable. 

In Islam men and women are equal in essense (4:2)

In Islam women are completely self regulating.
- Legally enter in contracts and make decisions in her own name
- Rights to work any profession she chooses
- Right to start any business of her choosing
- Authority to manage her property and assets as she choses
- Entitled to inheritence as a mother, wife, sister, daughter
- Full freedom to select her husband, no force by anyone in her family
- The Mehr, bridal gift is of her choosing, and for her, not the family, anything she requests, and is not a purchasing of the wife hence it is to only go to her (4:4)
- Within marriage all of the necessary bills and maintance of her life is to be granted
- Women do not have to marry
- Marriage does not give rights to a man over a woman person or her belongings and wealth
- In marriage it is a command on men to remain physically fit as husbands
- Rights in politics - She can participate in political convention, street demonstrations, congregations and Friday prayers. She has right to self defense and defends her property and even she can participate in war to defend the sovereignty of her own country
- Right to. education big deal!!
- Economics - A Muslim woman is allowed to involve herself in economic activities following some rules. The women who are highly talented and have the opportunity to acquire higher degree can render services for the betterment of the society, particularly in the teaching profession. But here too, a strict Islamic code of conduct has to be observed in the classroom
- Sexual and emotion cannot 

The Solution
- We are going to go over the rights of women within Islam based on the various social roles in society

“if she is a wife, she is life partner, if she is as a mother, the paradise is under the feet of mother, if she is daughter it is blessing of Almighty Allah”

Mothers
- Sons are meant to give support to their mothers if the husband is not, but only if he is able to and can afford it, preventing any need for mothers to be placed in elderly care
- Even if the son leaves Islam he is still meant to treat his mother well and care for her if needed and possible
- 

Wives
- Meant to be treated with kindness, it is said that the best of men are the men who treat their women well
- To afford maintenance is not only legally approved but also it is an act of devotion (ibadat). Under Muslim law, maintenance is due to the wife from the husband as a recompense for the matrimonial restraint and is one of the necessary and inherent conditions of the marriage contract
- Maintenance is a duty...such a duty that must be discharged cheerfully without any censure, hurt or patronization (65:7)
- In divorce there an iddat period in which the husband is still responsible for her maintenance
- slam does not impose liability upon the wife to bear expenses of the family or to bear expenses of her husband on any condition
- Rights of residence - A woman has freedom to choose residence for herself. In Islam, as it is the liability of husband to provide proper maintenance to his wife, a married woman must stay to her husband’s place of residence. Considering the ability and benefit of her husband a married woman can select her residence in such place as dignity of the family is properly maintained. According to the direction of Islam she cannot claim her residence in such place which will be some hardship for her husband.

Daughters
- Are meant to be given education and raised well, in Islam raising daughters brings great reward
- Inheritance is meant for daughter to be provided

Sisters
- 

Aunts

Divorce 3 types

- she wife has a right to seek divorce (khul’a) by renouncing her claim to the dower
