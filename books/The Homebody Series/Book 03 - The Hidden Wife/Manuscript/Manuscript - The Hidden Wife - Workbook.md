## Chapter 04 Defining the Man
### The Description
Write about who your husband is as though you were speaking to a complete stranger without mentioning his status, money, and career. Get as detailed as possible.

### The Numbers
Now you will get practical about the cost of the lifestyle you want to live as a wife. You will not be factoring in kids, we need to get you working with a husband first. This is to be done under the assumptions that your husband will be covering all of the necessary bills for the home.

The necessary expenses are as follows: Rent/Mortgage, phones, internet, electricity, water, insurance (car, home, life, travel, health), transportation, food, your feminine health care products (not your makeup), and any medications that you currently make use of.

This will require you to do some intense research so get your nerdy glasses on and prepare yourself with your favourite beverage and snacks of choice.

**Action Steps**
1. What city or town would you be living in?
2. What is the monthly costs (rent/mortgage, electric, water, maintenance, internet, home insurance, etc.) of the type of home you would like to live in with your husband?
3. What would be the costs of transportation (public and/or private), car insurance if applicable, and mobile service providers (phones)?
4. What would be the ideal monthly costs for groceries to feed the both of you?
5. What would insurance cost to cover the health (doctor, dental, eye, etc.)?
6. What are your necessary monthly expenses as a women to maintain your health and beauty?
7. Add up all of these expenses and compare it to the average income of a man living in the city or town from question number 1.
8. What would you expect to spend on leisure activities (dinning out, weekend outings, shopping)?
9. Review your numbers. Do they look realistic to expect of a man? If not make some adjustments, remember the aim is to have a fulfilling relationship with the man not just his resources. Keep in mind the more a man has to earn the less time he will have for you. It’s a trade-off and no you cannot have both simultaneously.

### Day in the Life
You will need to describe a day in the life of the man you would like become your husband. From the moment he wakes up to the moment he goes to sleep. Where does he go? What does he do? Who does he interact with? 

Think W5H.

### SWOT Analysis

- Weaknesses: Qualities that work against against him being a husband.
- Opportunities: Aspects he would need to improve on as a husband.
- Threats: Barriers to becoming the husband you would admire.

### Deeper Understanding
You will need to push your imagination here, really consider the life he lives and the challenges he may be facing in his life as a single man.

**Action Steps**
1. What and who is he responsible for in his life? Think beyond the finances.
2. What are the pains that he is dealing with and carries with him?
3. What does he have or do that gives him fulfillment in his life? Big and small.
4. What does he aspire towards in his life? What drives him? Think beyond just his career.

6. Make a list of his core beliefs, limit yourself to a maximum of 12.

### His Needs & Wants
This exercise will give you an idea of the requirements your future husband will have in a wife (you). Yes, ladies, do your best to put yourself in the mind of a man seeking out a wife. You have been around me enough to have a decent understanding, start there and expand on it.

You got this.

**Action Steps**
1. You will brainstorm a complete list of his needs and wants in a relationship as a husband.
2. Select the needs out of his list, these are not negotiable and cannot be more than 1⁄3  of the entire list.
3. The remaining items are his wants. You will need to split this list into his primary and secondary wants.

### Bonus Work
For those of you feeling brave, do some field research into the man you have described. Do you know any men like this? Where can you find them sharing their thoughts online (Hint: Try Reddit)?

Part of your research can be doing informational interviews with men via email, DM, or in-person who have similarities to the man you desire. Think of who you have access to that are husbands, elders, community leaders, etc.

Remember the purpose here, is to gain a better understanding of who your husband may be and to confirm your assumptions to the best of your abilities. Yes, you can do all of this from the comfort of your home. You phone will be more than enough, get creative.

3. Based on your list of group activities you will now need to pull out the activities that require you to go outside of your house to be around the people.

### Standing Out
You need to find ways to stand out from the rest beyond just being fit, feminine, friendly, beautiful, and inspirational. I’ll assume you are already keeping your physical health and mental health in check along with being minimal with the makeup, if any at all.

What’s going to have you stand out is your character, it’s all about how you present yourself. Remember, this is a man who other women are after, so get competitive. I know it goes against the “sisterhood”, but we must be honest. Today’s “sisterhood” does not support you traditionally minded women in your pursuit of married, hence the term “Pick Me”. Remember jealous women created this term, let them hate.

**Action Steps**
1. Refer to the work done in the previous chapter, this will be your source material. Read it over.
2. Based on the pains that he experiences and carries, how would you assist in relieving them?
3. Based on what fulfills him in life, what can you do to ensure it is maintained or expanded on?
4. Based on his responsibilities, how can you be a support for him?
5. Reflect on the kind of women your man would attract. Write some descriptions of who these women are. This will outline who you have to be better than.
6. Based on the descriptions from question 5, in what ways can you present yourself in the world that will have him and his network see you as the better option over the rest of women after his commitment?

**Action Steps**
1. Research what an elevator pitch is, and read some examples.
2. Write an elevator pitch that would be used to let a stranger know of the type of woman you are, highlighting your uniqueness specific to being a wife.
3. Write an elevator pitch that would be used to educate a stranger on the type of man you would be interested in having court you.

### The Network
You will now identify and make use of your network as a form of support for extra eyes and ears on available men. Keep in mind this list is not about quantity, this is about the quality of people and quality people only.

**Action Steps**
1. Create a list of people in your life who you know with confidence will support your values, beliefs, and the image of the type of man you would like to have court you. This can be family, friends, colleagues, and acquaintances.
2. For each person on the list consider and write how they can best serve you in being found by the type of man you desire.
3. For each person on the list you now need to categorize them under the following.
    - The Listener: Are they best at listening and giving you a space to vent your frustrations or share your excitement?
    - The Connector: Are they strong in making connections and taking a stand for you?
    - The Grounder: Are they consistent in telling you the harsh truth, even when they know you will be angry at them?
4. Make sure you have one person in each of the previous categories mentioned. Reach out to the people in your lists and present to them your pitch as part of a greater conversation about your desire for marriage.

This is now your Marriage Crew, learn to depend on them moving forward. It would be in your best interest if they were happily married or have positive outlooks towards marriage that align with yours. Absolutely no negativity is allowed. You can help your fellow women after you have helped yourself first.

### His Interests and Hobbies
You will now take all of your new learnings and begin to apply them to the act of positioning yourself to become known by your envisioned husband.

1. List all of the activities and spaces online and offline where your type of man can be found, think interests and hobbies.
2. Based on your list remove the activities that would not have a 60% male, 40% female ratio in attendance on average.
3. The remaining list items need to be categorized under online and offline activities.
4. For the offline activities you need to begin to reach out to women who engage in these spaces, always prioritizing those who are married. Start to get to know them and build relationships with these women. Most likely this will start online first, which is best for you, safety first.
5. Identity the next upcoming event that you can attend with these woman and commit yourself to going.

## Chapter 06: Keeping the Momentum
### Visualize
You will need to refer back to your vision board in our first exercise. It should already be your phone wallpaper.

Describe in writing how you would feel after having a conversation with your desired future husband about marriage. Everything went well, the areas that you didn’t align on were sorted out with care, consideration, and understanding. Capture that feeling in words as if you are on a walk home or laying on your bed remembering the conversation.

### Self-Care Activities
This work is not easy or always smooth so I need you to make a list of all the activities and treats you can give yourself when you are feeling low.

Get creative, think of your childhood, and have fun. These acts do not need to cost you anything, it could be as simple as laying upside-down against the foot of your couch.

This will be an ever growing list and I want you to aim towards not repeating the same activity within a week.
