The issue here is that women want to be heard, and men don’t want to labeled as perpatratures without clear evidence.

Sexual Assault vs Sexual Harassment are two distinct experiences.  

Assault requires a physical act.  
Harassment is a non-physical act, typically based on perception.

  
If you want more men to have an improved relatability to SA, we need to spend time acknowledging that it occurs at the same rate rate as women/girls and that the perpetrators include women. Women perpetrators are often dismissed and do not receive due punishments for their crimes.  
  
There are many boys and men when you ask them about their first sexual experiences you will find that they are very often underage with legal adult women and far more disturbing is how little they accept and understand that they have been SA’d and are victims.

  

A number of legal definitions for SA as it pertains to men is that it must involve penetration to be considered a victim. With that definition men are never victim by women, women there’s a substantial amount of women who are perpetrators. Many of which when persecuted get let off without appropriate punishment. To make things worse in situations of pregnancy it is not uncommon that the male victim will have to pay their perpetrator upon legal age for child support.
