Istikarah : you know what i want and what is best for me guide me to it. // Allah guide me in how to do what I know is in my heart to do

53:33 There’s someone as an example for this. 

4:17 Forgiveness, I will turn away from the wrong ya Rabb with that particular woman in those instances. 

84:25 I believe I do righteous deeds and only operate from a righteous place with others… but not myself…

80:3 Allah I do not know or understand…

66:4 could this be Allahs reminder for me to know that as long as I do right I will be protected…so what I am I played afraid for???

53:33, 4:17, 84:25, 80:3, 66:4
