## Before You Read
- This book is not about dating or casual relationships with men
- The “man” I speaking on is one who aligns with your values and needs
- This can get very emotional, remember that there’s no attack or assumption on the man being 
- This book is a primer to courtship, the term “dating world” is only used to reference the current environment. I do not promote or encourage dating for men or women.

This book is not for the weak at heart and mind. I will guide and I will push you. I will put you to work. 

This is what you signed up for and I’m proud of you for being courageous and investing in yourself.

If done with full conviction and effort you will only have to do the bulk of this work once. Even if you make it to marriage and it doesn’t work out the foundation of what you will have completed will still remain in place for you.

Let's dive in and get started on this exciting journey towards being found!

## Chapter 2: Embracing Marriage
Far too often women who seek marriage and want to be the best wife they can are often called a “Pick Me”. This is nonsense! Why wouldn’t a woman who seeks to fulfill the most important role ever as a wife and mother not want to have a good loving husband who honours her.

Think about it. Are the women who tell you this living the life you want?

Now, to set the record straight, being called a “Pick Me” is now a badge of honour. Trust me the men don’t see it in any negative way, and neither will your husband.

We are going to start with accepting and embracing your desire for marriage. As a traditional woman, you may feel like society doesn't value your dreams of finding a loving husband and starting a family. It's important to remember that your desires are natural and valid, regardless of what others may say.

Finding a partner takes work and dedication, it's not something that happens overnight. By accepting this reality and being willing to put in the effort, you can increase your chances of creating the life you want.

It's important to believe in yourself and the possibility of having a fulfilling relationship. It may feel overwhelming at times, but keeping a positive mindset and staying hopeful can help you stay motivated and focused on your goal.

By embracing your desire for marriage, you're taking a significant step towards achieving a lifestyle you can be comfortable and proud of. This chapter will provide you with the tools and support you need to overcome any doubts or shame you may be feeling.

### Overcoming Marriage Shaming
When it comes to wanting to get married, women often face criticism and judgment from others who typically do not share the same values or goals. The judgement often comes from scared, bitter women who haven’t taken responsibility for their shortcomings with men. 

You are not them!

You have decided to learn, reflect, and do the neces work to get what you want and need. Their words can be disheartening and hurtful, but it's important to recognize that these negative opinions do not reflect your worth as a person or the validity of your desire for marriage.

It's understandable that people have differing views on marriage, but it's crucial to remember that your goals and desires are just as important as anyone else's. No one can tell you what you should or shouldn't want for your life, and you shouldn't feel ashamed or guilty for wanting them. It's important to acknowledge and embrace your desire for marriage as a natural and healthy aspiration.

Finding a fulfilling marriage can be challenging and require effort, and it's worth it. Don't let the negative opinions of others discourage you from pursuing your goal. Remember that it takes work to achieve what you want in life (just like school), and that effort is worth it in the end. Trust yourself and your own judgment. Do not let others sway you from what you truly want. Your happiness and fulfillment are worth fighting for, so pursue your goals without fear of judgment or shame from women who try to make you feel less than.

### Hard Work and Faith
Embracing the reality that getting married is hard work requires acknowledging that being found by a suitable husband and building a healthy, lasting relationship takes effort, patience, and resilience. It means accepting that the process may involve disappointments, rejections, and setbacks. Progress may not always be as linear or as predictable as you may want it to be. However, it also means recognizing that the work put into finding and nurturing a fulfilling marriage is worthwhile and can lead to a lifetime of happiness, love, and companionship.

Having a solid belief and faith in oneself and in the possibility of beating the odds is crucial to staying motivated and persistent in the face of challenges and obstacles. Belief means having a conviction that it is possible to be found by a man who shares your vision, values, and goals. A man who is committed to building a strong and fulfilling relationship. Faith means trusting in one's ability to grow, learn, and adapt to the changing circumstances of modern culture and relationships.

By embracing the hard work that goes into finding a suitable partner and building a healthy, lasting relationship, and by cultivating a solid belief and faith in oneself you can approach the this process with a positive, resilient, and proactive mindset. This mindset can help them overcome the fears, doubts, and negative influences that may arise along the way. Stay focused on your vision and purpose of searching for a committed, fulfilling, and loving man for marriage.

## Chapter 3: Defining the Man
“Where are the good men?” a common question and point of frustration amongst many women today. So let me answer it for you. Most are married and the rest are much smaller pool then you have ever imagined. 

These men tend to not be seen because they keep themselves busy investing in spaces and people that will benefit their future. They don’t frequent the bars and clubs, are not loud and all over social media. But, there is core reason why you don’t know where your husband is and it’s all in your control.

You have never thought about him, described him, took time to investigate who the type of man you desire is as a human being beyond the lifestyle you would like for him to provide you.

Don’t stress. Breathe. I got you.

### He Has Desires Too
Understanding what men are looking for in a wife is a crucial factor in achieving marital success. It requires diligent effort to identify the qualities and traits that men value most in a wife.

This kind of consideration fosters trust, respect, and appreciation from a good man, making it easier to explore, collaborate, and overcome any challenges that may arise from courtship to marriage.

Ensuring alignment of your needs and some of your wants with your envisioned husband also enhances a your chances of being found and accepted by him. It enables you to avoid settling for someone who may not be a suitable match fundamentally — I’m talking character, not money or status. Instead focus on building a strong relationship with someone who shares in your morals, values, and outlook.

Compromise is inevitable in any relationship, and when you are willing to align your desires with his, it reflects your willingness to work together and become the lifelong support that all men crave.

Lastly, know that a good man will honour, respect, and make exceptions for you as his woman. As long as you remain loyal and strive to align with him, he will do his part to give you room and space to become and grow. But in order to get there your man need to see you as a cooperative and submissive to begin with.

Let’s call it investing in yourself and the future life you want to live. 

When a man has decided he is ready for marriage he chooses from the women around him. This is typically done through word of mouth within his social circles. If your name doesn’t come up as a candidate he will never know you exist and in turn another woman will be the wife of your husband. 

You are in competition for a husband against every other women who is in search of a man like yours. It’s best for you to drop the ego and accept this. There’s too few marriage minded men at any given time for all of you to get one exclusively.

### Hindering Your Results
As a woman seeking a husband, staying at home and not going out severely limits your chances of being found by a man who is looking for a wife. It's not enough to rely solely on online platforms or introductions through close friends and family. To increase your chances of finding a committed relationship, you need to actively put yourself out there and be visible in social settings. People need to know of you and speak well of you for this to work. 

Attending events, joining groups or clubs, volunteering, or participating in activities that you enjoy are great ways to get started as long as they get you out of the house. Being an unknown homebody and not going out can and often does give the impression that you are not interested in meeting a man or you already have one.

Finding a partner requires effort and stepping out of your comfort zone. It's important to be open to new experiences and be willing to take risks in order to be found by your man.
