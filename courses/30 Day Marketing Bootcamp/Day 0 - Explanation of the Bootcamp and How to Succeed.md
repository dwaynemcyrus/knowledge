## Summary

## Handouts
1 - Download the TikTok App from your App Store or GooglePlay Store 
IOS - [https://apps.apple.com/app/tiktok/id835599320](https://apps.apple.com/app/tiktok/id835599320 "https://apps.apple.com/app/tiktok/id835599320") 
Android - [https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.ss.android.ugc.trill](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.ss.android.ugc.trill "https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.ss.android.ugc.trill") 

2 - Create an account When creating your account, make sure you verify your email address/phone number. We don't want to make TikTok think you're a spammer. The same thing for when you're using a VPN, TikTok knows if you're using one and I recommend you to turn it off. 

3 - Pick a username When you pick your username, avoid using a bunch of underscores or dots. Just keep it simple. 3 combined words max. Use short words. Your most favourite usernames will probably already be gone, so you need to get a bit creative. I guarantee if you really try, everyone will find a cool username that makes you think: _"Damn, I can't believe nobody took this name already!"_ 

4 - Profile picture For the profile picture, we can start with searching for "Luxury Pictures" and picking an aesthetically pleasing picture. Maybe of a fast car, a penthouse. Whatever. We'll change it later. 

WARNING - Don't use pfp's of Tate. They can get you banned for impersonating. 

5 - Your biography As we're purely focused on growing an audience right now, our biography will be optimised to get people to follow us.

You need to make sure your biography assures that people can imagine what they get from following you. 

*"Daily Tate Clips"* 
*"Funny & Motivational Videos"* 
*"A Unique Insight Into Tate's Life"* 

This bio for example tells me exactly what I can expect by following this page. I get daily clips from Tate, those will be funny and motivational, and I will get a look into Tate's life. 

6 - Posting our first TikTok Our profile is now created and we're ready to post our first TikTok. 

Just click on the "+" icon and upload your video. 

In the description we will write a one-liner about what this video will be about. _"Tate explains what's more important than money."_ 

After that we will add 3 hashtags that match the topic we talk about. 
*"#money #masculinity #andrewtate"* 

And that's it. Your first video is uploaded.

### An important note for the TikTok game:

The TikTok algorithm loves Tate.

But it doesn't like it when we break their TOS (Terms of Services).

Here are a few things that will either get your videos banned immediately or put them at a high risk of getting banned and should therefore be avoided:
- Embracing alcohol, cigars
- Showing violence
- Racism, cursing or any discrimination against sexuality
- Anything sex related, even talking about sex is risky
- Shooting guns
- Speaking about politics or government 
- Get rich quick schemes, anything with money in the picture or frame, even dollar signs or trading

Read all the guidelines here:

I assume everyone is aware of the guidelines.
