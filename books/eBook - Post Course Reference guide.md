	4.	List Situations: List specific situations in these areas where you think a boundary could help.
	5.	Prioritize: Rank these situations based on urgency or importance.

Overview: Create a visual representation of your boundaries to understand where they are needed.
Steps:

	1.	Draw a Circle: On a piece of paper, draw a large circle in the center.
	2.	Label Areas: Divide the circle into 4 sections, each representing a single area of your life that needs the most attention right now.
	3.	Identify Boundaries: In each section, write down the boundaries you currently have and those you think you need.
	4.	Inner Circles: Draw circles around each boundary that you can directly influence and control.
	5.	Journaling: Reflect on which of your circled boundaries are clear and respected, and where there might be confusion or overextension.

Day 3: Assessing Boundaries

Overview: Evaluate the effectiveness of your current boundaries and write clear boundary statements.
Steps:

	1.	Review Map: Look at your boundary map from Day 2.
	2.	Choose Boundaries: Select the most urgent or important boundaries from each area.
	3.	Write Statements: For each chosen boundary, write a clear and specific statement (e.g., “I will not answer work emails after 7 PM”).
	4.	Be Positive and Assertive: Ensure your statements are positive and assertive, focusing on your needs.
	5.	Review and Refine: Read through your statements and refine them for clarity and strength.
