Open 89:17 Honour, be righteous treating even the orphans well. Are reverts considered orphans?

  

50:1 Turn to Allah, be a reminder of Allah. Bring people to the Qur’an, I been on this message for people to read! To know the practicality of the Quran and Islam. (1-2) Become a Warner an example, be like the prophet in truest of forms…Dawah 

  

40:61 even Destiny today was telling me I need to get my sleep in order. Get the Muslims to remember their Islam, focus on the Muslims heavily! There is bounty in Allah so do as the Creator demands. You want success sleep at night wake in the morning.
