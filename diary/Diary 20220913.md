As Muslims we should lean toward counters rather then fear tactics 

  

Gentlemen there are many women who just want the story of you not your plan and vision, no matter how good and beautiful she is she not the type to marry

  

Ask her if she was able boy married once ? 

  

How many courtships has she been through? 

  

Read her your ideal day get her thoughts

  

I need to map out my responsibilities as a husband and the needs of becoming that man along with my ideal self 

  

I need to become aggressive assertive and competitive in the world
