## Evaluating themes
- Create a simple markdown template like [[Sample Typography in Markdown]] to test out various theme's aesthetics
- Always be sure to test the copy with the editor and preview views
- The Graph View is very customizable so do not stress the look of this too much
- The treatment of typography is what's most important as this is where you will spend most of your time
- Always check for the display contrast of asterisks, single vs double
- It's always best to have the headers be easily distinguished by colour
- The display of code blocks is important
- Also make note of having the options for alignment to be left centre, or right
