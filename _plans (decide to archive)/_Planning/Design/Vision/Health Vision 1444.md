**Definition:** The general condition of your body, mind and spirit being happy, healthy and prosperous and free from disease, pain and stress.
## Akhirah
Respect the body that I have been on loan so that it may better serve Allah SWT.
## Vision
A mind of the stoics, impenetrable by negativity and influence. My emotions are always under my control, I do not break, ever! My emotions are always expressed in a healthy manner with the right people and in the best of places to be received. There are no “old stories” that I carry around with me that limit my thinking and belief in self.
Always disciplined in my behaviour be it the training of my body, its physical care, what I consume as food and media, the people I associate with, and my mental health. I hold myself and the care of myself as my number one priority in life. The best of trainers and health practitioners are with me and aid in the maintenance of my sculpted and near perfected physique physically, mentally, and emotionally.
My body will well built like that of an olympian on the rings, track runner, and swimmer. Having compete in regular bodybuilding competitions and winning, I am the example of health in a man and whats possible with discipline.
My diet is fresh mostly home cooked meals that I have prepared and when I have my wives they will take over as a means of freeing up my time to do more greatness in the world.
