## Summary
An extremely simplified method of implementing the Zettelkasten system into Obsidian using 4 folders.

## Highlights
- The benefits of Zettelkasten increases with keeping it simple by minimizing distractions and the use of unnecessary information
- Zettelkasten is meant to reveal your categories of interest over time and not for them to be preplanned in advance, think organic growth 
- This system uses 4 folders to setup...
	- Zettelkasten: contains atomic “idea” notes
	- Reference notes: used to reference books, articles, etc
	- Files: container for images
	- Templates: container fir template notes 
- Use command control o to start a new note as it allows you to see if you already have an existing note
- Maps of content: is when you a bunch of notes in your graph view cluster around a particular idea
- Don’t over complicate things from the beginning, just start and allow the process to inform you

### Setting Up
1. Create your 4 folders 
2. Set your attachments folders to files, to hold everything in on place this keeps things simple
3. Hotkeys set "insert template" to command T
4. Keep the Zettelkasten option off as tempting as it is 
5. Plug-ins don’t matter, they are distractions so don’t get caught up. However, the author uses *Admonition* and *Sliding Panes* which is now a built in feature for Obsidian
