### Business 101
Why people will give you their hard earned money
- This is the foundational principle of why people give you money
- As a business owner you don’t make money, it’s given to you, transferred 
- Why did you give someone else your money? It solved a problem I believed valuable 
- It’s because you believed you are getting more value than you were giving
- Everything in business and life is a trade-off, is a value exchange from likes, to watching a 15 second TikTok, to giving years of your life to a cause, to spending millions on a Bugatti 
- And both sides feel like they are getting a good deal that’s key
- Understand that money is not created it’s a trade that is mutually beneficial, a trade of value you must understand and feel this principle! 
- **There is limitless money out there if you can engineer these mutually beneficial trades for people** 
- This is more about collaboration vs combat, teacher thinks this is a better thought than scarcity and abundance
- You MUST think collaboration, what value are you bringing to any human being think of life like this, from your live streams to friendships, everything!

### The Value Equation
Key to massive money
- All of business is a trade of value
- How do people perceive value when it comes to products and services
- Look up the originator of this equation, [[Alex Hormozi]]
- A significant amount of value is in perception, so a big job of the copywriter is to control their perception and increase the perceived values 
- This is not a numeric equation but more of a demonstration of relationships between these concepts and how they can be manipulated 
- Manipulation means handling with care and yes we are being taught how to manipulate people (influence over their emotions) use it for good not evil 
- The elements in the diagram is what we need to control to change the perceived value being formed
#### Equation breakdown
- Maximize the top to increase the perception 
- Dream outcome = value you are promising, ie. losing weight, getting a date
- Perceived Likelihood = how much do I believe this will work for me
- Time to get outcome = what is the time required to get that result
- Effort and sacrifice = minimize this with sayings like “you can continue to eat what you like while still loosing weight”
- This equation is all about perception...
	- It’s about comparison like 1year vs 5year to get the same result 
	- Perception is all about comparison 
	- Assuming the products work and deliver, then it is your moral obligation to help the user make this decision
	- Give quick emotional wins, ie loosing 100lbs in a year, and mentioning that you can loose the first 10lbs in the first week. You have given the user an emotional quick win to visualize that feels good (this is called time to get outcome)
	- Weaponize the ideas of comparison! To increase and decrease perception.

### Know, Like,  and Trust
The foundation of salesmanship 
- Business is the trade value you give something scalable, they give you time, energy, money, and you trade it back and forth to gain more money
- There’s a key component that facilitates this process of trade which is implied trust
- How is trust created? People buy from others they know like and trust 
- [[Alex Harmozi]], "Sales is a transfer of belief over a bridge of trust"
- How do you get people to trust you when people are more hesitant than ever especially online.
	1. Social proof, if the tribe runs in a direction you are likely to go in the same direction and run too, we take cues from other people 
	2. Indicators of authority, we have been conditioned to trust authority like a person who is a doctor or a man wearing a fireman’s outfit — investigate the shock experiment of how far people will go. This is a good factor to use to help someone make a faster decision. Authority is a powerful motivator.
	3. Indicators of competency, showing they have a professional understanding and a bonus if they understand your problem better than you
	4. Relatability and likeability, if the can relate to you, aspire to be like you, they will think he is one of us and trust you, he speaks and talks like me, there are actual tactics to get people to like you, look them up. Also the more you are liked the more they think you have their best interest at heart
- It’s not enough to just get these initial points of trust, trust needs to be magnified by trading up
- The more you continue successful transactions the more they will trust you, you want to increase your successive value of trades like an email newsletter, consistency is the key! The track record increases which gives more reason to stick with them because you are increasing confidence
- The more you do this with the small things the bigger the trust builds
- It’s not just the amount, but the value. The more a business is trusted by their market, the more customers they will get, and the more they will be able to sell 
- The better you get at building trust with a business from their customers the more valuable you are as a copywriter 

### LTV and Scale
The two levers of success...
- The core foundational background of business success is the following. The previous lesson give you the groundwork of understanding to get here.
- “Nothing can fix bad math”
- Two factor that determine how much the business you work with will make, it separates the good businesses from the bad
	- LTV = Lifetime Value, the amount of profit generated by an average customer 
	- The amount of customers that you help (scale)
- You need to have both fit for this to work, Apple is a great example, and a kids lemonade stand is most likely in a negative in comparison
- Always think about how you can maximize each lever for your client starting with the LTV because finding new customers is much more difficult and expensive 
- Always analyze businesses for how they can increase either of these levers
- Increasing LTV gives you the ability to increasing scale
- Increasing LTV needs to be the bread and butter! 
- High profit and high customers is the aim

### The Value Ladder
How to maximize LTV 
- “Whoever can spend the most to acquire a customer wins” - [[Dan Kennedy]], this is the key to winning, you want to have a monopoly in your industry 
- Help businesses figure out how to make more per customer so they can pay more to attain more customers
- If your LTV is $10 you can’t spend anything more than $10 to acquire a customer in a profitable way
- Value Ladder
	- Value can be in the form of time, energy, money, a like, a share, etc. 
	- Here’s an example of a weight loss company targeting soccer mom customer in the steps of action.
		1. Amy is 100lb overweight
		2. At home scrolling IG invests 90 seconds to watch a 4 tips to loose weight video
		3. Follows on IG and visits site to receive a 10 step guide to loose weight and subscribes to their newsletter
		4. Now a fan and constantly consumes content, then is sent an offer to buy a $49 ($1-100) a diet guide to loose weight as a busy soccer mom, she does it, it works, she loves the brand
		5. Sent a 21 day challenge she joins ($100-1000) the group and makes friends she’s lost the pounds 
		6. Offered a Costa Rica trip ($1000+) to do more healthy activities like run on the beach, be with like minded people, she goes enjoys it 
	- In this example they move Amy through the value ladder while helping her change her life along the way
- Not all companies have this ladder, and as a professional you can spot the gaps in their ladder and fill it. Often it’s about increasing the ladder. Continuity is key within the value ladder.
- Memberships are between low to mid ticket 
	- Low $1-100
	- Mid $100-1000
	- High $1000+
- Some people will buy everything from a brand so always ensure there’s something for them to buy
- Some people will only buy halfway and others just the beginning 
- The key is to get paid by all of these people, help them a lot and get paid a lot! 

**Value Ladder:** A series of escalating trades of value for money that a business seeks to ascend the customers along in order to maximize the value the customer receives and their LTV to the business.
