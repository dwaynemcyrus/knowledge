I wanted to quit it all this week…

Pushing myself every day and not seeing the expected results have been disheartening.

The fight to get out of the prison of my mind was difficult. But, the fight to stay out and create a new way of being is a unique struggle.

### Here’s what I gained by dragging myself forward…

When we act on what aligns with our desired direction in life resistance shows itself in new ways.

Far too often we criticize ourselves for moving too slowly, not doing enough, and for our failings. Rarely do we reference our past progress as the measure.

Our marker of comparison is usually the achievements of another person. And we use this criticism as a tool to beat ourselves down, not to continue, to hold back, to stop.

This is WRONG.

We cannot afford to stop.

Our movement must continue. This is how we achieve momentum.

Momentum is the key to our success. It is built on consistent discipline and in this practice, our feelings DO NOT matter.

We made the decision to move forward, don’t go back on your word.

Change course, learn to [[rest in motion]], anything but to stop.

Keep moving.

Sincerely,
*Dwayne Cyrus*
