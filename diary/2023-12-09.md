- [/] Reset with GTD…everything!

Istikarah 
I’m going to bet on me and be an independent creator to earn a living for my family of 12k CHF every month so that I can be at home with the family and make my worship. 

Open: 
1:6 The opening of the Qur’an, to be guided on the straight path. Subhan’Allah! 

First:
3:83 You intentions are good…why do you question what Allah SWT has put in front of you?
80-86 Follow the Prophets…do not be of the disbelievers, you are a messenger, so message!

Second:
80:4 Remember and never forget as you will be reminded in ways that are not pleasant to you as you already know. Is there more Allah SWT?
1-7 Do not be arrogant seek all opportunities to spread the message. 

Third:
72:12 You are in need of Allah SWT and you must work! So what am I missing in this Allah SWT? It’s above of me.
9-15 Be of those who follow, who submit from human and jinn kind. There is no other paths, everything leads to Allah SWT.

Close:
52:36 Allah SWT is the creator of all things..you can be as uncertain as you won’t just follow the signs of Allah SWT. There is nothing more for you to do in this matter, just follow.
33-39 Stop testing Allah SWT do you need see how foolish that is. Stop. The creator has given you signs and proofs, yet still you doubt the message, your resist to be the message.
