[DAY–00]
Welcome to the tribe. 

This newsletter is designed to support your healing and growth as survivors of trauma. 

A safe haven of ongoing support and encouragement. Letters to educate and push you through the challenges of recovery and the building of a life on your terms. 

Words matter. 

My mom always said, *“If you have nothing good to say, say nothing.”* These are words I live by. 

If it’s not beneficial to you, I will not write it.
### The Benefits For You
Each week, you’ll receive three carefully crafted emails, each with a specific focus to guide and inspire you.

- **Consistent Support:** Receive regular, reliable support and encouragement three times a week, helping you stay focused and motivated.
- **Valuable Insights:** Learn from in-depth discussions on various healing topics, providing you with actionable strategies and knowledge to apply in your life.

### Behind the Words
My name is Dwayne, a man on the journey to a life on my terms, sovereignty—but everyone calls me Cyrus.

An outspoken survivor and wounded healer. Mentor and coach to those doing the inner work to recover healthy relationship to self and others.

More about working together once I know you are a human being.
### Verify You Are Human
To ensure that my efforts here are going to those who are invested in themselves and doing the work. 

**Please reply with *“Hey Cyrus”*.** 

You will really make my day (for the second time). 

For you overachievers, don’t just say, *“Hey Cyrus”*. Tell me a bit about yourself and the transformation you are working towards in your life. 

That's everything! 
***
As always thank you for giving me the most precious resource, your time.

**Peace to Power,**
— Cyrus

**P.S.** I often write a little postscript on my emails. Like this one. They are usually funny or smart or odd. So make sure you read all the way through.

**P.P.S.** If you ever want to **reply** to any of my emails, please do. I'd love to know what you are thinking and I promise to read it.
