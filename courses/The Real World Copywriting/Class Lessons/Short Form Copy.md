## Notes
### What is short form copy
And how to master it for good
- This is the beginning of your copywriting career
- Short form is the beginning of any kind of engagement with a brand or business, it’s to sell the click not the product
- Examples of this are newsletters, social media posts, tweets, social media ads
- The purpose of it is to give them a reason to leave their current platform for another like a landing page. Think, from a chaotic place to a controlled and catered environment, where there are less distractions like a Lambo showroom. You want to take them from the sidewalk to the showroom
- You need to understand not selling in the inbox, and in doing this you will sell much more.
- **You want to bring people to where they can get sold to.**

### DIC Framework
(Disrupt Intrigue Click)
High curiosity short form copy
- This framework is a series of steps and a foundation, it’s all about grabbing attention and getting them to click
- Steps: Disrupt > Intrigue > Click
- Disrupt: This is where you catch their attention, if there’s an image use a disrupting image because they will see this first, it needs to be different from their environment. Think pattern interrupt. It's also the first few lines of long-form copy. Instill some intrigue and curiosity, little bits.
- Intrigue: Amplify and stack the curiosity and intrigue until the reader can’t help but take action. Multiple fascinations, not-statements, creating unanswered questions, etc use all the tools to tease. When they get to the end they need to have low-grade anxiety, the splinter, for them to desire an answer. 
- Click: Simplistic is a single line with a CTA (call-to-action), now you simply direct them to take the action *“hey, you want the answer click here”*. A good CTA contains all 3 elements of the DIC, as most people will scan the email to the bottom. Be sure your CTA doesn’t reveal the *“answer”* to the secret you have been teasing, you want to keep the mystery alive.
- A Bonus can be a PS at the end of the email. For example, to drop even more intrigue on the reader or to amplify their pain or desire. 
- **DIC works well with cold traffic, people who don’t know anything about your brand and products**
- You can use this to get people to consume more content videos, blogs, podcasts, etc. 
- Recommends most short-form copy stay under 250 words
- The primary text is the intrigue
- Emojis are cool for disrupts in subject lines
- On IG the CTA is usually referenced to the link in the bio
- DIC is a format you will use A LOT as a copywriter

### PAS Framework
 (Pain/Desire Amplify Solution)
Get them to move from the short-form copy...
- This framework is great for inspiring action and providing motivation especially once they have already discovered the answer. This magnifies the emotion to take action.
- Steps: pain/desire > amplify > solution
- Pain/Desire: You can use either one, dangle the carrot or whip with the stick. This is where you stop them for their attention and hit them with a great emotional experience by amplifying their greatest button pain or desire
- Amplify: Humans have many ways of self-soothing and minimizing the emotional intensity of our pain and desire because it’s easier than changing to fulfil the desire or fix the pain. 
	- To get them to take action you must stoke the flames of their existing pain or desire until it propels them to action
	- You do this with sensory experience you want them to play a movie in their mind to trigger a corresponding emotion. Sight smell taste sound and touch, you don’t have to use all, but the more you can the better and more vivid the movie. Use this sensory information that’s around that pain or desire
	- You do this with future pacing, you want to give a taste of what could happen if they don’t solve the problem by highlighting the reality of not taking the action. However, it’s better to go the positive route than the negative in most situations.
	- Show them how their pain or desire can connect to their higher need think Maslows you can amplify the compulsion to act.
	- You can show them how their situation or dream affects their status in the eyes of others to magnify the emotion
	- Take their desire and show them how it connects to their greatest wants and needs
- Solution: Direct them with a simple line to direct their action to resolve their heightened state of emotion. There are a few levers you can pull to enact this:
	- A reader believes there’s a limited time to take advantage of an opportunity, the pain/desire is amplified, you want to create urgency and play with time 
	- Scarcity, this is more about the availability and or quantity of the solution to solve the problem. A boat with 2 seats remaining with 20 people in line.
	- You can one last time crank on the dial of their emotions to push them over the edge.
- PSA is how you get people who have already experienced DIC to take another or the initial value exchange.

### HSO Framework
(Hook Story Offer)
Shift their brains with the power of story 
- This is all about shifting belief and inspiring desire and curiosity using the power of story
- 3 main sections: hook > story > offer
- Hook: Catching the attention and getting them to want to read the story, usually done with one strong fascination (a bribe to read)
- Story: Humans have evolved to change beliefs, make decisions, learn and absorb information through the power of story. Think of the hieroglyphs, books of scriptures, because stories guide people, shift beliefs and allow the reader to sympathetically experience the same emotions and transformations as the characters inside. Similar to when you are watching a movie and cry or feel an emotion. 
- All stories follow the hero’s journey
- The journey starts with describing the known world, then the call to adventure
- Important storytelling tips
	- Start the story at the height of drama at the moment when all seems to be lost, preview the drama, the scary, the wild. Think Bond movie trailers 
	- Ensure the main character means something to the reader, and some aspirational elements so the reader can identify with the character and see themselves as the character to become emotionally involved. The main character and the avatar need to match. We are able to relate to people who are like us. 
	- Skip parts of the story to create intrigue. Lead the reader up to the point of despair then fast forward to the point when they are living the dream. This creates an extreme information gap which creates curiosity that you can capitalize on in the next phase. 
	- Offer: Direct them to take action to calm their curiosity to fill in the information gap or direct them to follow the path of the character you have walked them through (the journey) so they can mimic it themselves. The CTA is similar to the others, DIC and PSA. 
	- **HSO is great way to get readers to experience the solution.**

### Short Form Copy Best Practices
Avoid the land mines and win
- Most short-form copy should be under 150 (250 max) words to force you to only use impactful words to keep the reader's attention and avoid mistakes, per email, FB ad, etc plus it’s about the most a read will likely take the time to consume.
- Mini skirt rule, Long enough to cover the important parts, but short enough to keep things interesting. 
- In copy, reviews ask, *"Does this add to the copy? Does this take away from the copy? Is this neutral?* This exercise keeps you in line with only what adds to the experience and end goal.
- Each piece of short-form copy should have only one idea or you begin to sound crazy and dilute your power and effectiveness. You want to bring all of your persuasive power to bare.
- The **thread**, your copy, should all comment one into another. Each line should make you want to read the next line. There are no gaps or friction, each line builds on the next. It needs to be fun and exciting you are competing with everything that can distract them, their dog, TikTok, IG, etc.
- Use normal fonts and keep the grammar and spelling on point, don’t use words like *"this"*, or *"it"*, be specific, always.
- Avoid long paragraphs you want to maintain 1-2 lines because on mobile it can turn to 8 which is uncomfortable for readers. Keep it to one complete idea in a paragraph, never split up an idea. 
- Use bold, italic, and underlines sparingly these are meant for emphasis and to draw attention. Too many and it loses the effect. Once or twice per short form copy.
- Emojis when appropriate, they add some emotional context, they were made to express emotional subtext.
- Avoid sales clichés, readers are highly in tune with these and trigger sales guards and they dismiss you. Keep it personal you are speaking to one person.
- Avoid overly formal language, make it feel like a conversation between two friends, make it personal communication, and remember whoever can show they care the most connects the most and wins. Have fun with your writing as the reader will pick up on this! And enjoy it too.
- Writing can be fun make it fun and make it fun for the reader

You can make up a fictional customer story for the HSO email if you'd like  
  
Be sure to review each email after you write and iterate through a few rounds of improvements.
### Example
Here is an example of what the completed mission should roughly look like.
