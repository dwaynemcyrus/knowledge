Allah I need to focus myself and I am failing massively! It no longer enough for me to just wing it through life. I need to put into action clear focus and preparation, and they to get here is through writing and visual art and storytelling. 

  

The storytelling is the kapstone to all of my endeavours, the comic, blogging, vloggng, teaching, public speaking, articles, books, illustrations, videos, poetry, etc.

Today we will return to who I am by getting clear on what I must let go of and if there’s anything that I fear. It is necessary for me to get into alignment with Allah by reviewing my documents and beginning to work with discipline again.

  

I must clear my mind and 🤔 my and achieve clear focus as a man. 

  

0934 I have wasted enough time, may Allah forgive me I will educate myself now and show gratitude to my creator by doing.
