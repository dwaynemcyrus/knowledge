[[Al-Mu’id]], 
I give up my life, my old ways, the limiting beliefs, the false image of myself for that of a [[Rijal]], a [[Mujahideen]] . In submission to your guidance and your laws, and the examples set fourth by the prophets especially [[Musa]] and [[Mohammad]] , Peace be upon them both. 

I will study and emulate the character of the sahabah [[Talha]] and learn from my council members [[Malcolm X]], [[Nelson Mandela]] 

I seek the best of this world and within myself to be an example to my brothers and sisters of what a Muslim at his very best in all areas is to be like. All of my faith and understandings of this [[Dunya]] I place in you and will be guided by you. 

I am your servant, nothing more, nothing less. I will live in the highest states of [[iman]] (faith in Allah), [[taqwah]] (fear of Allah) and [[tawakkul]] (sole reliance on Allah) with [[Sabr|sabr]] (perseverance and persistence). 

*In gratitude,
Dubhan Talha Mikha’el abd Al-Khaliq ibn Kourosh*
