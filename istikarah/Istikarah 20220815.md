How do I stop sabotaging myself?

  

Open 114:6 this seems like it’s going to be a deep message here to apply to both.

  

18:59 suicide and any form of self harm is wrong… very very wrong. We get sin for that we are meant to care for our lives and cherish it. Allah does not like this at all, be sure to check some more research into this . 

  

95:3 (3-6) Allah this is deep, where are you taking me with this? Are we talking about security seeking security in you Allah like the last one about me seeking more knowledge to protect and fix myself? Or are we referring to the Hijra the change of location to the change of environment to fix my mind? 

  

92:6 (3-10) Had to look up Al Husna and to my understanding it means “the names of Allah” to believe in all of Allah, each and every characteristic. There’s also mention of doing right and Allah has given you a purpose and platform and gift. This may be the solution and the means of all things for you moving forward! Damn!
