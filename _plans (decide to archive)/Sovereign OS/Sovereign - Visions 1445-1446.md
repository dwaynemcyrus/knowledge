I go to places and do things that 99% of the population will never experience or have the ability to do. Constantly exposing myself to various cultures, ways of life, and of course the people. I and my family are nomadic, roots reaching out all over the world. In all places I venture to I paint memories of the environments and the people which brings me great joy. My life is about painting and making memories of God’s creations everywhere that I go. I am not a tourist anywhere, I am a global citizen made local wherever I am. 

Dance and music are core to my expression and experiences of the world. I am trained in various styles of dance and am deeply involved in creating and DJing music in a number of ways. I tell stories with my crafts and it's a beautiful adventure for me to learn to build new things from RC planes to architectural models and imaginary worlds.

An accomplished and academic man of institutional accreditations specifically including a doctorate in psychology and coaching certifications in IFS, ICF, CPCC, ACC, and PCC along with a few other areas of recognized study and trainings. I have proven my accumulation of knowledge in both the academic and street world of self study with my digital garden.

My personal website is a treasure trove of all my accumulated knowledge synthesized for others to benefit. It is my second brain on public display for the world to see and benefit from. My brilliance and practical accumulation of knowledge is an impressive feat to my community and I am know for it.

I have a regular practice of self study that is specialized to my interests in art, history, Islam, trauma, psychology, quantum physics, health, relationships, power, branding, and personal development. Everything that I have needed to learn to make myself an amazing mine is accessible in my second brain and in my various essays, articles, and thought pieces.

Accompanying my vast and specialized knowledge are equally specialized and perfected skills. My ability to write, draw, paint, build, fight, heal, and speak in the digital landscape are top tier. A force not to be reckon with as I am deadly in the arena of intellectual pursuit and creative endeavours that require artistic abilities — my body is also a weapon of destruction and endurance. I embody speed in all things as I know it beats everything else. A polyglot and master communicator, I am that guy. My mind and mouth and hands are more a source of power and influence in any domain I preside.

### Destination
My knowledge of Islam is like that of a scholar and my reputation is very high in and outside of my muslim community. While also maintaining that my character is always in development. A hafiz and beautiful recitor of Qur’an with full knowledge of modern and Qur’anic Arabic. I can also speak in Qur’anic versus that’s how good my memorization is.

Most importantly my applied faith and absolute trust in Allah is second to none. Now of course it is nothing like the prophets, but I do my best to get as close as possible and remain in Taqwa. Everything I do is meant to be inline with the laws of Allah SWT as an obedient slave.

Lastly, I am seen as an unofficial sheik by the Muslim community at large around the world. This is simply because of my trying to educate and relate Muslims and non-muslims to the fundamentals of Islam. Always dressed as a Muslim, and recognizable as a Muslim.
