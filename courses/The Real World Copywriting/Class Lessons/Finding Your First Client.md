- UPDATES - New Prospecting Method
## Summary
***
## Notes
### Goal of Prospecting
- The aim now is to find 3-4 clients who will pay you $12k a month so $3-4k each by identifying who may fit the image
- Each client is an asset worth 10 to 50 to 100k a year in $, they are not easy to find and requires much work
- The next few sprints is about finding these potential clients to help them make money and in turn help yourself make money
### What makes a good Prospect
- **We are looking for people online who need to make more money**
- We are doing this **to get paid in 1-3 days** of providing your marketing services
- **DO NOT** help broke people, we are not a charity

Prospect Criteria 
1. They must have money
2. They must be in pain, they want to improve their marketing, and have an opportunity to take advantage of, they need to be selling digital products online to a large market with high margins, the greater their margin, the greater your profits, **DO NOT** target local selling and/or low margin products
3. Need to have an audience in the form of social media and or their email list, you need an established audience to be able to help them, it also says that this business has something the audience cares about
- These are the clients who will be able to pay you $5-10k for brining in clients for them

### The Buying Window
- At any given time only 5-10 percent of any given audience is in need of the services you provide
- We are not in the business of trying to convince people to buy our service, we are after those who know they need us and just don't know who to get it from
- Companies go in and out of the Buying Window all the time, you'll want to reach out to past prospects to catch them when they are ready, usually within 6 months
- You want to be able to quickly identify those who are in the buying window
- **DO NOT WASTE** time trying to convince or argue someone into the buying window

### Niche and Finding Prospects
* NOTE: Mine will be ==personal development coaches and mental health practitioners and relationship coaches, teachers of art and code, people selling to women==
- Niches is key to finding those first 4 clients
- 5-10% at any given time are in the buying window which requires a large pool of prospects, typically 1 client within the first 2-3 hundred contacts made. This is an inefficient way to land work so we must narrow the target
- There’s a few top-level niches that cover all sub-niches
- A niche is a problem being solved by a business
- The big 3 niches are health it’s a universal problem, relationships people have pains and problems in sexual and non-sexual relationships it’s a major and very extreme pain, wealth people want wealth and don’t have wealth
- The big three niches are too broad and need to be narrowed by looking for very specific problems example health: yoga mats, online gymnastic training for people wanting more mobility
- To find these hundreds of companies, you need to begin big and break it down into its smaller niches and select from there to find your hundreds of companies 

### Good Local Business Clients
- Include in your search for prospects local clients, gyms, barbers, doctors, dentists, people who sell high ticket, high margin services
- Restaurants are not good as they have low margins unlike a gym or chiropractor, to find them search these businesses in Google maps and Yelp
- Be sure to test out different business and approaches you will typically be writing FB ads and run offers to book calls, improving website landing pages, revamping social media
- Be sure to follow the test email that he teaches you

‎  
Some of you have noticed some of the changes to my recommendations for outreach.  
‎  
I'm going to be releasing a full update in the next few days,  
‎  
But in the meantime I want you to have my latest and greatest recommendations.  
‎  
Watch these videos to make sure your outreach is dialed in.  
‎

‎  
The big, big change --> https://vimeo.com/801007708/901efcdec4  
‎  
TLDR  
-   Don't use Streak
-   Do your outreach one by one
-   You only need 10-20 prospects max per day
-   Do you research on what your prospect type's top 1-3 pains/goals are
-   Make sure your outreach is perceived as valuable to your prospect.
