The [[Pareto Principle]] aka the 80-20 Rule

## Journaling App Replacement
- He was using the Day One app and has since replaced it saving him money
- Plugins required: Calendar (Community), Templates (Native), Periodic Notes (Community)
### The Setup
1. Install the Calendar plugin turning on the weekly count display
2. Activate the Templates option that's native to Obsidian and create a folder with the designated name from within the settings
3. Install Periodic Notes
4. Setup your [[Daily Note Template]] and your [[Weekly Note Template]], both with some prompts placing them within the "Templates" folder
5. Create a new folder called "Journal" to hold your daily notes?
6. Periodic Notes options turn on the "Daily Notes" and "Weekly Notes" and assign your folders for each option such as "Journal/Daily" and "Weekly"
7. Because the Calendar and Periodic Notes are made by the same developer you can click on the calendar date to create a new entry or the weekly count. Try it by clicking on each in future days
The dots you see in the calendar show you how much you have written that day with each dot representing the value set in the plugin setting, by default it's 250.
## Kindle Highlights
- The links within the summary take you directly to the position within the book in the Kindle app
- You can set the format of the template as well, making this extremely useful
- The plugin is free, so make great use of it
## Kanban
- Remember `CMD + P` is to tell Obsidian what we want it to do, such `Kanban > New board`
- The visualization allows you to create boards that you can interact with
### What do we use this for?
To visually track systems of production that are repeating processes and for tracking decision making, in essence, this can be seen as an [[OODA Loop]].
**Example Structure:**
- Idea: Holds the notes and script
- Scripting
- Ready to Film
- Ready to Edit
- Ready to Publish
  Published: The is typically left here to archive
#### Use Case No.2
Planning various things such as purchases
**Example Structure:**
- The research: Which has notes on the options of purchase
- Down 2-3: The options have been narrowed down
- Decided: A direction has been chosen
- Purchased: The item has been purchased
## Better Word Count
- Obsidian has a built in word count that is decent, but cannot read highlighted text counts
- You can remove the default word count in `Settings > Core > Word Count`
- This comes in handy for Publishing, especially for things like Twitter where the word count is limited
## Recent Files
- This will save you a great amount of time in being able to locate files by back-tracking
- You can drag the display down to the bottom left opposite the calendar
