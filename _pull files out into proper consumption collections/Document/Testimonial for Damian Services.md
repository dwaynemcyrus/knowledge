## Question 01
**What was it like for you before we worked together - your experience of life/situation, feelings, challenges, etc.?**
Before we worked together my experience of life/situation were the following:
- Feeling overwhelmed, frustrated, and lost with the lack of a career and trajectory to follow and pursuit.
- Extremely uncertain about how and where to employ the skills and knowledge that I have to better my life.
- Lacking in a network, more specifically how to make use of the network I have.
- Isolation and hopelessness with my lack of a plan to achieve the future life I desire. 
## Question 02
**What did we work on during the time together that made the biggest impact for you and on what you were dealing with before?**
Teaching and working through my conative has made the greatest impact for me. Gaining a clear understanding of how I best operate when in pursuit of achieving a goal has been extremely affirming. I have had hints and a vague understandings of how I best operate when achieving success, though the clarity and language was surely missing until our work together.

A game changing moment for our work had been the first informational interview that lead me down a path towards my true self while affirming my identity. The experience lead me towards a practice of developing my network as an artist, furthering my connections with existing relationships, and most importantly gaining a clear direction for not only my career, but my life as well.
## Question 03
**What is your experience of your life/situation, feelings, challenges, etc. now vs. before?**
The following is a list of my experiences that are now different from before:
- Focused and at ease with the direction of my career and life path.
- Certain and accepting of the skills that I have along with where to employ them to better improve my life.
- The skill and confidence in developing my network of men who are successful in their careers, along with professionals in the fine arts.
- Feeling less isolated and more hopeful about my future, there’s a growing confidence and excitement with a clear plan towards it.
## Question 04
**Are you able to quantify the difference working together made for you and/or your business?**
Yes, I can quantify the differences made by working together as the following:
- A clearly written plan of action (with data driven research) to living my new life in Southeast Asia by September 2023.
- The start of a new business in digital marketing with a specialty in content creation via copywriting to fund my life and transition into a career as an artist.
- A growing network of 200+ people who are of value to the world and within my career trajectory.
- The documentation and presentation of my original artwork at [A Muslim Artist](https://amuslimartist.con) as part of beginnings of living my life as a full time independent artist.
- An appreciation, gratitude, and new connection with the positive qualities and characteristics that my father has passed on to me. 
## Question 05
**How do you see your future now?**
My future is now seen as extremely bright and in my control. The past does not dictate my future or present, where I am in the moment is all that matters, as my present dictates my future. 

The future that I am going to live in the next 2-3 months will be one on my terms with a healthy separation from my born-to family. A life of healthier eating, an active lifestyle, and sunlight in Malaysia. This will provide me with a much improved and simplified cost of living while travelling and finally experiencing life on my terms. 

Once my experience of Malaysia is positive and to my liking I intend to make it my new home on this rock we call planet earth. I look forward to buying land and building my home here as it is very possible and have seen some incredible custom homes on YouTube. There’s also a consideration in the future to invest in a property in New York as a second home as an artist.

As for my career I will be spending only 20% of my working time each week to generate and increase my income, doubling it every 24-36 months. The 80% will be solely focused on creating. I will become the most influential visual artist, a household name in Singapore, New York, London, Dubai, and Hong Kong. My works will surpass that of Takashi Murakami, Ai Weiwei, KAWS, Beeple, and Jean Michel Basquiat.
