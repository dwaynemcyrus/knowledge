@0726 Here I am on the floor feeling sorry for myself after I wasted so much time scrolling TikTok to passify myself like a fool. 

Ugh… that disgusts and me pisses me off.

@1821 Here I am again having woken up at a terrible hour after being up so long. My mother is stressed, my sister is doing a bit better and I am at the root of being the solution to everything here. I’m confident my mother’s stress is her house to be more specific.

How do I recover today? What do I do first…how do I let go of all the doubt… why am I remaining this way?

These are all stupid questions you are asking yourself. Just get it together as a man. It is simple.

Reset the mind.
Identify the problem. 
Focus the mind. 
Solve the problem. 
Consistency.

Do what you must, period.

You are a man of your word so be that, live that, own that. There’s no other option understand! 

Get pissed off about your situation okay.

@1833 Complete your review so that you have a clear look at the landscape you are working on.
