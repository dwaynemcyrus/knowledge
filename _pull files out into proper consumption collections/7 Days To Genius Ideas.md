**Note:** The content notes were supposed to be gone over in the 3 days before the 7 day email prompts. Not simultaneously as you have it written here.

- [ ] Update these notes to go under 3 headings…The genius Method, The Rundown (how to reduce…), and 7 days of Emails
- [ ] Copy over the Notion templates into Obsidian
## Day 00 — The Genius Method
### Welcome
> Writing is about clear thinking. Clear thinking is about the quality of your ideas.

> This process is backed by psychological studies, ancient wisdom, and years of trial and error.
> 
> This process is how you **get into a deep creative flow state, gain clarity on your goals, and birth ideas** that _catch attention, impact others on a deep level, and form the foundation of all communication_ (writing and speaking).
> 
> When done correctly, all it should take is 10-minutes — morning or night — to see positive results from this habit.
> 
> (You can easily do this for hours. If you get into a flow state, buckle in and enjoy!)

- [x] Download the Notion template *[Intelligent Imitation](https://prong-ketchup-228.notion.site/7-Days-To-Genius-Ideas-7351ff867d994388afead4d3e79e79d3)* for use from [[Dan Koe]].
### The Challenge Starts Tomorrow 
- [ ] Make a community similar to [Modern Mastery](https://www.modernmastery.co/) and call it [[Sovereign Society]] this will be your online community.

> If you aren't pursuing your intrinsic curiosity, you are pursuing someone elses.
> 
> By developing the thoughts and ideas related to your interests
> - You tap into flow state more often
> - You reach expert status in those interests
> - You WANT to do the work that will allow you do pursue your interests full time

> "Sensible people get paid for doing what they enjoy doing."
> — Alan Watts

> Nature favors creators because creators live in accordance with nature.
> 
> Creators (of media and tech — writing and code) are who help society evolve.
> 
> Creative work and work that allows for more creativity.
## Day 01
### Email Notes
**Prompt No.1:** The point of this is to dissect the depth and meaning behind the tweet.
1. Find your favorite author, speaker, or entrepreneur on Twitter
2. Scan through their tweets
3. See which one catches your attention
4. Plug it into the "Topic" area of the Notion template
5. Flesh out your thoughts and follow The Genius Method process
### What Is The Genius Method? 
- The Genius Method is a way of transforming boring ideas into Genius Ideas.
- An all-in-one process for note-taking, journaling, and generating original ideas for articles, newsletters, videos, tweets, posts, speeches, and more.
- A 10-minute-a-day process that can be included in your morning or nightly routine.

**A Quick Rundown Of The Process**
Here is a summary of what you will be doing in these 10 minutes:
- You will take good ideas from what you consume, see online, or have in your head
- You will summarize the idea, write out your personal experiences, benefits, pains, potential metaphors & frameworks, and common objections.
- You will create a 1-sentence quote-like summary of everything you wrote out
- You will organize these inside the Notion template, categorize them, and add relevant notes
- You will start to recognize patterns, have better ideas, and continue building a database of original Genius Ideas that can be used in life and business.
- You will gain the confidence to start posting your ideas online, attracting a following, and realizing that even that guy with 1 million followers is a normal human being (that stayed consistent).

> The purpose of this writing process is not to explain, it is to understand.
### Homework
- [ ] Complete the work from the email prompt.
## Day 02
### Email Notes
- A method called Braindump journaling.
- The steps to braindump journaling
	1. Reflect on a time this week when you were stressed, reacted negatively to someone else, or were just overthinking.
	2. In the "Topic" section — write out what you were overthinking about
	3. Run through the genius method to gain deeper awareness about that problem
	4. Reframe the situation into benefits
	5. Understand your own objections (your limiting beliefs)
	6. Summarize it into a one-sentence big-idea that you can refer to when it happens again
### Idea Generation
**Video Notes:**
- Create ideas off your failures and turn them into positives
- Books are just condensed versions of peoples courses, etc.
- You need a list of people who you want to study and pull from in depth.
- [ ] Write out 5 -10 of your mentors people who have and share great ideas this is where you take ideas from and make them better (.ie Alan Watts, Clark Kegly, Cale Hastings)
	- Al-ghaazhi
- [ ] As part of your daily routine, note down any events as little stories from your life.
- [ ] Look up who the following people are: Alan Watts, Clark Kegly, and Cale Hastings

> **EVERYTHING IS AN IDEA.**
> 
> The thoughts in your head.
> 
> The lesson that this phase of life is trying to teach you.
> 
> The content that you see online.
> 
> The list goes on.
> 
> The difference between a creator and a consumer is that a **creator applies their ideas**. **Consumers let them get stored in their head to cause overwhelm.**
> 
> Now that you have something to do with all of the ideas you are exposed to (with The Genius Method) you will start to see life in an entirely new light.

> [!tip] Something to Practice
> 
> Start to gain awareness and consciousness of everything happening around you. Is there a lesson you can pull out of everyday experiences? This alone will make life more enjoyable.
### Capturing Your Ideas
- Write everything down. EVERYTHING!
- [ ] **Note:** Get your note taking system back into play from Notion that you had made. This system seems very similar to this. It's interesting how what is obvious for you people are selling and charging money for.
- When you have something that comes to mind that you want to remember, open **The Queue** (Notion) and write it down.
- **ONLY** capture ideas that **cause you excitement**!

> In terms of _ideas to capture_, only capture the ones that cause **excitement** in your brain.
> 
> This is dopamine.
> 
> Dopamine separates signal from noise.
> 
> You will have to become more in tune with yourself to master this.
### Want An Endless Supply Of Good Ideas?
- Dude this information is straight out of the [[Snow Leopard by Category Pirates]].
- I had a whole system  for doing just this, I was already here. I just didn't have the knowledge that it was valuable! OMG 😡

> But **consume with intention**.
> 
> Consume for the sake of research.
> 
> **No more mindless scrolling.** Dedicate a specific amount of time to learning about what you are interested in. (Again, listen to the dopamine. Look for the excitement.)
> Follow people that are teaching what you want to learn on social media.
> 
> Buy a book that will give you a broad overview of the topic you want to learn about.
> 
> Subscribe to podcasts, YouTube channels, and blogs.
> 
> Surround yourself in an echo chamber of your interests so you become an 'expert' in way less than 10,000 hours.  
> 
> **Life is a game of imitation**. We were raised imitating our parents, friends, and teachers.
> 
> If you want to do what you love for a living, imitate the person that is already seeing success from it.
> 
> Learn from them. Turn their good ideas into your own original ideas and take your piece of the pie.

- [ ] Define a set period of time each day to consume intentionally for the purpose of learning about what you are interested in.
- [ ] Create an eco-chamber on social media and all other places where you consume 
#### What Should You Put In The Queue?
- Tweets that stick out to you
- Thoughts that are bothering you
- Quotes from your favorite creator
- Highlights from the books you are reading
- Headlines of blog posts, YouTube videos, and podcasts (these are usually the creator's "Genius Ideas)
- Anything else that you want to remember (that you won't end up turning into Genius Ideas
### Homework
- [ ] Inside of the Notion Hub under "Imitation & Inspiration" write out 5-10 of:
    They are teaching you everything they know about their expertise. These people should be aligned with your interests and what you could see yourself doing in the future.
	- Your favorite authors
	- Your favorite social media accounts
	- You favorite YouTubers, podcasters, and bloggers
## Day 03
### Email Notes
- [ ] Book to get a read called *[[The Art Of Impossible by Steven Kotler]]*
- Have a routine that you follow to lead you into getting focused for work, like a walk with an interesting audiobook. This is work without working.
- After your walk the act of sitting to do focused work, becomes simply a matter of organizing your thoughts
- [ ] Go on a walk and get ideas, plug them in bro 😎 
### Good Ideas
**Video Notes:**
- The more people who back your argument the more persuasive you are
- Quotes get placed into the references section of the template 
- Define your topic first
- Then move into your brain dump 
- When defining the big problem always consider your own personal experiences
- objections can be people asking questions
- [ ] Look up who this is Anthony De Mello
- As you do the exercise you will realize where your gaps are in information and this is where the magic lies
- When you create the framework it acts as a guide for yourself
- The big idea is about what’s going on here, what will draw attention
- The genius idea can be used for anything including your own personal thoughts and experiences
- Writing the Big Idea is in the next section

> For most people, the journey stops here
> 
> They let their notes, thoughts, and ideas sit on their virtual bookshelf to collect dust and cause worry.
> 
> This is why it is important to make this a part of your routine.
> 
> So you are consistently riding the dopamine wave of idea generation and pattern recognition.
> 
> **Action follows inspiration — so schedule inspiration into your routine.**
### Turning These Into Good Ideas
This is where ideas start to fly and build the foundation of impactful and persuasive content that’s repeatable.
#### Step 01 — Topic
This defines what it is you will be writing about.
1. Duplicate the template or create a new blank template based on the tool you are using.
2. Copy the idea from The Queue and place it under the “Topic” heading.
#### Step 02 — Braindump
1. Write out everything that comes to mind when you read the idea.
2. Write a brief summary of the topic in a way that YOU understand it at this point in your life. 

#### Step 03 — References 
Being able to back up your argument is important for credibility. And people just love seeing quotes and tweets in your articles or newsletters.

> Where did you get this idea from? Is it from a quote? Tweet? Article?
> 
> Paste a link to it under the references section.(You can skip this part if you don't have any.)
#### Step 04 — The Big Problem
Creators solve problems for people, that’s our job. We get paid in proportion to the problems that we solve.

**For the big problem —** think back to experiences you've had, others have had, or that is talked about often. You can research more articles on the topic to see what common problems people are talking about.
##### Why The Big Problem?
Marketing, persuasion, influence, attention, and anything else all starts with a problem. This is the start of impacting human behavior.
#### Step 05 — The Big Benefit
**People are selfish, you included.** Whether you are talking to a friend or someone online, people are ALWAYS searching for "What's in it for me?"

**For the big benefit —** What is the big benefit to overcoming this problem?
##### Why The Big Benefit?
Transformations. That's what people want. That is the foundation of marketing, sales, attention, persuasion, writing, speaking, and impact.

Point A is where they are now (the problem). 
Point B is where you help them get (the benefit).
#### Step 06 — Objections
You can research other content to find this answer, but it may take you a bit longer than 10-minute.
1. Do you have limiting beliefs when overcoming this problem?
2. What are common excuses you hear regarding this topic?
##### Why Objections?
The only reason people don't solve their own problems is because they talk themselves out of it. Same goes for you.

Handling objections is how you build self-awareness and how you make people more aware of their problems. This is ultimately what changes human behavior.
#### Step 07 — Personal Experience 
Tell a story, paint the reader a picture.
1. Do you have experience overcoming the problem?
2. How did you do it?
3. What was it like?
##### Why Personal Experience?
Humans want to connect with other humans. Humans make sense of the world via concepts and symbols.

Stories are a series of concepts and symbols with a dash of emotion.

Stories are how you get people to listen.
#### Step 08 — Frameworks 
An optional step, but highly effective.
1. Can you create a step-by-step way for people to overcome the problem?
2. How would you overcome the problem if you were faced with it again?
3. Can you slap a compelling name on it and make it your own? (So people can remember it and tie it back to you? **Hint:** The Passion Process is one of mine.)

This will help you overcome the problem when it comes back into your life — and it can serve as a future book chapter, piece of content, course, or other product.
##### Why Frameworks?
If Point A is the problem and Point B is the benefit to the transformation...

Your framework is a unique, step-by-step way for helping them get there. That is what books, coaching, courses, and content are.
#### You Will Get Better At This
> If you are having trouble writing these out, don't worry.
> 
> Your brain will get used to generating more ideas.
> 
> You will start to connect more dots.
> 
> Give it time.
### Thoughts
- [ ] Figure out what the steps are for making atomic essays for Twitter from the 30 Ship 30
- [ ] Find the YouTube video about writing small essays about a topic and and this to your process.
### Homework
- [ ] Go for a walk and note your ideas into the system
- [ ] **Bonus homework**: research "customer levels of awareness." It will help you create better content and sell more of your product.
## Day 04
## Email Notes
- People with over 100k followers don’t know more than you, they just have better systems and consistency.
### The steps of success
#### Step 1 — Understand what someone does on a DAILY basis (relating to your interests).
> Most people try to sell their skill, rather than the application of that skill. Nobody wants a web designer, habits coach, or other commodity.
> 
> How does that help their everyday human experience
> 
> _Is that not all that matters at the end of the day?
> 
> How is your product or service going to affect my LIFE on a day-to-day basis?

**An example of what [[Dan Koe]] does:** 
> I am a content creator with a wide range of experience in marketing, health, philosophy, and other interests.
> 
> I am going to target content creators because I have experience in that niche, I understand what they do on a daily basis, and I have direct access to them.
> 
> **What do I do on a daily basis?**
> - I generate content ideas
> - Write articles, newsletters, threads, tweets
> - I promote my products and services to make money
> 
> Those are the main things — t**he levers that make my business run**.
###### Questions for you…
- What do YOU do on a daily basis that you are good at?
- Have you improved yourself in any area of your life that you spend money on often to improve that area of life?
- Who can you attract by teaching, posting, and talking about that area of life online?

People are interested in enhancing their everyday choices — because the only thing we have is the human experience.

**This is the trickiest part**. The rest gets extremely simple when it comes time to make money doing what you enjoy.
### Step 2 — **Understand the problems related to money and time.**
**Side note:** if you want to get a specific person to pay you, you have to understand their day to day problems. That means you have to be where they are — a few steps ahead of that.

You need to do what the people do who you want to help. For example…
- If you want to help content creators, start creating content.
- If you want to help tech companies, work at a tech company (or learn how to do market research).
- If you want to help writers, write (of course you will have to learn and practice how to write).

**An example of the problems [[Dan Koe]] had related to content creation:** 
> - I couldn't post to all platforms without spending all day on them
> - I didn't know how to land clients without sending cringeworthy cold DMs
> - I didn't know how to monetize my audience as it was growing
> - I didn't know how to sell my product enough to pull in a consistent income

This will give you direct experience with the problems people encounter as they do this. Once you solve those problems, you can sell the solution.
- [ ] You need a list of the problems you have solved for yourself or the problems you have and currently are experiencing.
### Step 3 — Flip these problems on their head.
- **People buy transformation for their human experience.**
- [ ] Write down the opposites of the problems in step 2. This would be the benefits or what their life looks like after overcoming these problems.

**An example of the opposites to the problems of [[Dan Koe]]:**
 - Post on all platforms in under an hour a day (I'm actually creating a course on this now, it may be live by the time you read this)
- Land clients without sending cold emails, DMs, or posting on the timeline (I've already solved this via email marketing automation and sales strategies, [they're in MMHQ](https://powershift.krtra.com/c/byeIsJNO38rK/RwBaA))
- Monetize your audience with the knowledge that's in your head (Also in MMHQ — offer creation.)
- Create a predictable income from your audience and earn up to $1 per follower you have per month (Same problem with offer creation and promotion)
### Step 4 – Turn those benefits into book chapters, course modules, coaching call topics, freelance service features, or a physical product that gives those benefits.
If you don't know HOW to solve those problems, self-educate. Invest in courses, coaching, and other specific knowledge that you probably won't find at college.

**An example of course modules from [[Dan Koe]]’s problem/benefits:**
- The 1-Hour Content System (a content repurposing system I would create)
- How to close clients without cold emails, DMs, etc (an email marketing system I've created)
- The Godfather Offer framework for turning your ideas into an irresistible offer for your audience.
- The Feasting Artist - how to make predictable product sales as a creator

With all of these pieces of information you now have a target audience, landing page copy, and a product or service outline.

The [7 Days To Genius](https://powershift.krtra.com/c/3VYDKRsEnxYf/RwBaA) landing page breakdown: The first bullet point list are the problems, then a story, then the benefits, then I tell you the sections of the program. Now you are a marketer.

- [ ] Review the landing page for [7 Days To Genius](https://powershift.krtra.com/c/3VYDKRsEnxYf/RwBaA)
#### How do you sell this new product?
- Turn all of the bullet points into content. It’s already relatable and will catch people’s attention.
- Create your product
- Create your landing page 
- Plug the landing page under all of your posts
## Better Ideas
**Video Notes:**
- It’s an emphasis on the problem, benefit, or objection
- Make it as a one sentence summary. 
- You get better at this the more you study headlines, copy, and just good content.
- Make the sentence fresh, give it a unique take by checking if others have written it the same. 
- Give your sentence depth.
- Maintaining this habit is you documenting much of your life
- Content creation should be fun because you are causing others to think and solve their problems while you solve your own.
- [ ] Study what grabs people’s attention
- You want your dopamine hits to come from producing ideas
- You can write these in the form of Tweets (or whatever X calls it now)
- Organize your Genius Ideas into categories of interest
- Genius Ideas are about connecting your various ideas in new and unique ways
- [ ] Be sure to pull from your past system of note taking to support your system

> The teacher learns more than the student.
### Craft Your Big Idea
This is about practice and writing Tweets is a skill. Here are some questions to help the process:
- If you were to _try_ and summarize everything you wrote in one sentence, how would you write it?
- What is the big idea behind the transformation? (Why should people care?)
- Can you reduce the perceived effort of acquiring that transformation?
- Can you exaggerate the problem so much that it seems stupid not to solve it?

**Here is how you can start to prime your brain to think in "big ideas:"**
- Read headlines everyday.
- Read more books and try to dissect the big ideas.
- Read landing pages and sales pages.
- Follow more people that are trying to help people on social media (ditch the self-deprecating memes).
### Optional: Categorize
Treat this process as your own. The more you do it, the more you will mood it to your style.

You can categorize by color, tags, and topic for ease of exploration and connection.
### Homework
- [ ] Make your product a mix of [[Alex Jarmozi]] (Book: [[100M Leads by]] and [[JK Molina]] (YouTube) for your offer. 
- [ ] Make your sales page content, just the words.
- [ ] Produce 3 pieces of content based on the work. 
## Day 05
### Email Notes
Why Twitter (X) is the best platform for beginners:
- It is writing-based. Not image, design, or editing. Anyone can write as you are finding out.
- Tweets have a short lifespan — you can write as many as you want and test your ideas.
- Unlike other platforms, you can post links in the comments (more sales).
- The all-powerful retweet button shares posts to an entire audience at the click of a button (more traffic). Does any other platform do this? Maybe Facebook, but who cares about Facebook.

Twitter (X) is an idea testing machine
- Test big ideas, see what does well, and then create longer content from it — because you already know it will do well!
- "**Doing well**" in this case means growing my audience or selling a product.
- You must learn to play the game: how to get eyes on your profile, comments, and retweets.

Rules for starting your Twitter (X) journey:
- Don’t worry about optimizing your profile
- Work through the fear (that we all face at the start) of putting your idea in public
- Just hit publish
### Genius Ideas
- If you want to be a commodity in the modern world, become a specialist.
- If you want to be irreplaceable in the modern world, become a jack of all trades.
- The internet has sparked a new renaissance era. Your niche is you. People crave human connection.
- Genius Ideas are found at the intersections of your curiosities. This is where passion is born (it's actual science).
- [ ] Look into the science of passion
- When you become passionate about how the things you are learning about intersect and solve real world problems — that's when the magic happens.
- **Genius ideas cannot be written.**
- Attention is the most valuable currency in today’s world.
### Homework
- [ ] Do this process for 7 days straight
## Day 06
### Email Notes
- [ ] Look up Zach Pograb on [Instagram](https://powershift.krtra.com/c/bfo0Qxm1dXa4/RwBaA)
- [ ] Use one of his posts to develop one of your ideas
- [ ] Search for 12 accounts big and small that speak to you deeply
- Accounts that speak to you help you develop your own unique voice, you will become a conglomerate of your favourite voices
### What's Next?
If you are feeling the urge to share your learnings…
- Start writing tweets
- Start writing articles
- Start outlining podcast episodes
- Start outlining YouTube videos

If you are not feeling the urge to share your learnings REMEMBER THIS…
- You don't have to be a credentialed expert.
- You don't need some fancy process. You need practice. (And consistency)

> Teaching about the subject will help you enjoy it more — and turn it into a future source of income.
### Creating Is About Saying 1 Thing 1000 Different Ways (And Doubling Down On What Sticks)
Dan could have made this product:
- A 7-day marketing masterclass
- The foundation of sales
- How to create compelling content
- How to write compelling copy for your product
- I could go on...

> Everyone has the same problems.
> 
> The "how" (how you would solve that problem) is already out there.
> 
> The "why" is what gets the sale (and attention — the new currency).
> 
> The pain, benefit, story, big idea, emotion, and broadening awareness.
> 
> That's what makes people buy from you over someone else. That's what changes behavior and makes people remember you.
> 
> Your Genius Ideas are how you do that.
> 
> _A novel perspective that raises dopamine levels in the reader is how you do that._
> 
> I am selling a system, based on my prior experience, under a specific angle (why).
> 
> _It's that simple._
> 
> The only difference between me and the other guy is I put a buy button on my landing page and charge according to my experience level.
#### One last thing on "saying 1 thing 1000 different ways:"**
This is how you educate people and help them understand the DEPTH of a topic.

Talking about the same idea for weeks on end is not bad. It is very very good.

Attack it from all angles. Raise your readers awareness on the topic. _Bring them to your level of understanding_ (which will result in you needing to gain a deeper understanding).

**All of this creative work and business stuff is just self-improvement in disguise.**
### Homework — For Unlimited Idea Generation
1. Take one of your ideas in the Genius Idea Bank.
2. Research "Life Force 8" and "SCAMPER"
3. Now, tell me you can't create thousands of tweets, articles, videos, and more.
## Day 7
### Email Notes
Steven Kotler’s 5 intrinsic drivers:
1. Curiosity
2. Passion
3. Purpose
4. Autonomy
5. Mastery

For the past 7 days you have been pursuing your curiosity. Formulating ideas, fleshing out problems, benefits, and the rest. **Passion is found at the intersection of these curiosities**.

**When it comes to purpose** — you have to understand the utility behind these intersections and how it can impact the world. We've already done this. We've listed out problems for each.

- [ ] **Something to ponder** — is your purpose to help people solve the problems that these curiosities present?
- [ ] **When it comes to autonomy** — how can you pursue this full time? Gain control over the structure of your day?

The **one-person business model**:
- Social media as your traffic source.
- You as the brand.
- Your ideas as content.
- Your frameworks for solving the problems is your product (digital or physical)
### My Creative Workflow
- The workflow needs to be easy and systemized
- The Law of Inspired Action
- Have a list of mentors who you can pull from their Twitter posts or other content when you don’t have an idea
- Ideas come from books, emulating people in the same area, but on a different platform 
- Growth comes from sharing good content that already is good
- YouTube and Medium are great sources to pull from as you sort by most popular 
- Readwise is a good tool to pull quotes automatically 
- Schedule set time to go through your queue throughout the week
- His system looks like it was inspired from the bald guy you have notes on for the Notion system to manage life
- [ ] Look up who the guy is that created the Notion OS and then update the above bulletin point to link to him
### Creating An Article
- Always starts with long form so that he can later create smaller bits of content. 
- This is meant to build content that gets traffic and sells.
#### Step 1 — Research
- Link up a bunch of tweets, quotes, books, screenshots, or articles to pull inspiration or backup your arguments.
- Reference your own notes to pull from. 
- [ ] Look up psychic entropy
- [ ] Add to your daily routine, learning a new word and reading the dictionary.
#### Step 2 — Planning 
- Uses a very similar structure to the [[Genius Ideas]] template 
- This planning template can also be used for products
##### Structure Overview
- Topic
- Big problem
- Objections
- Big Benefit
- Personal Experience 
- Big Idea
- Key Points: This is the foundation for outlining the article 
#### Step 3 — First Draft 
- Start with the **body** 
- The **intro** is usually a personal experience with a good hook
- Last is to fill out the **conclusion** 
#### Step 4 — Publishing 
- B-Roll
- Headline and Hook Brainstorm
- Description 
- Thumbnail Ideas
- Tags
### How To Reduce The Friction Of Adopting This Habit
The challenge is to create one big idea per day in the Genius Ideas Bank inside the Notion hub.

​​​The easiest way to adopt a new habit is in the following steps.
#### Step 1 — Identity change
You need to gain deep awareness of a pain you are facing and live in alignment with the person you want to become.

If you want to make the switch to becoming a creator (not even for business purposes) — **that is your first prompt for the first day of the challenge.**

- [ ] In **The Queue**, write out what you think your problem is and run through the Genius Idea Template to understand what it really is.

Do it now.
#### Step 2 — Time blocking
If you have a plan, you are more likely to execute on that plan.

- [ ] Set a 10-minute block on your calendar for when you are going to do this challenge.
#### Step 3 — Add it to your routine
Do this challenge first thing in the morning or right before bed.

Doing it in the morning will give you creative energy to attack your day.

Doing it at night will clear your head so it is easier to fall asleep and get into "big-picture thinking mode."
