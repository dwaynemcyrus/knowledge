Using Anki
- He takes key concepts with screenshots and places the full page on the back
- He reads the card and asks questions on the back
- Each card he writes a challenge for each that he will then turn into making an art piece
- This is something like Or pretty much Zettlekasten
- After the training he reviews the work he has made in photoshop and takes notes on how to improve
- Sometimes at the end he makes a reference to his sketch training wit a screenshot or note
- For the Anki button you can hit “hard” i order for the card to show up more recently
- He only allows himself an hour to make his training with full focus
- He always has a card ready for the next day

Books
- Rediscovering gauche 

- what you studied is more important than how you study
- What do we study? Do we study a book to completion before advancing (blocked practice) or do we jump between a few resources (interleaving)
- he does interleaving which forces one to be more creative in completing the challenges
- un sports they practice the fundamentals skills for 4 hours at a time in football that passing, marking, sprints, dribbling, etc… you want to be drilling the fundamentals regularly so when you need to perform make a portfolio piece you are ready 
- Training everyday makes you a better artist each day you wake up 
- You want the fundamentals to become embedded reflexes for you, so you can access your creative genius
