Roadmap to Becoming a Legendary Category King: This is your reference material for building your content and monetization as a category king, a digital writer.
## Keys to Success
- Your goal is to be DIFFERENT, not a newer, faster, or smarter version of someone else.
- To be a “thought leader” you must be willing to LEAD WITH YOUR THOUGHTS.
- Your responsibility is to speak on what’s not said and to risks, challenge conventional wisdom, and allow yourself to be creative.
- DO NOT be outrageous or controversial for the sake of attention.
- The mission is to get the world to somewhere new because you are already  living in the future.
- When you create you are creating for someone. 
- Your goal isn’t to create one great book, but to create dozens of great books.
- The size of the question dictates the size of the audience, Obvious (lots of people have, “How can I make more money?”) vs Non-Obvious (few people, hyper-relevant, “What are jobs I can do as a stay-at-home mom with 2 kids working part-time?”)
- Thinking about thinking is the most important kind of thinking. 
- “Thinker’s High”: a rush of endorphins for consuming something that changes the way you see the world.
- The trade, when a reader gives you attention and/or money, they are really giving you **time off their life**. They need to know the “value” of your content, the “give-to-get”. E ither you are offering them something Obvious, cheap, easy-to-understand and consume (McDonald’s), or you’re offering them something Non-Obvious, expensive, and difficult-to-understand and consume that leaves them “wanting more”(Michelin Star Restaurant).
- Monetize while you can, do not wait.
- Always aim to gain a specific position in the customer’s mind.
- Always communicate the value in a clear and concise manner.
- All ideas have the same 3 components: problem, solution, outcome.
- “As a writer or creator, what you really are is an “Intellectual Capitalist” whose job is to “think”—and then to find ways to leverage that thinking into net-new value.”
- Using Non-Obvious, Non-Obvious is not a good idea except in very rare cases, “Let’s not be so smart we’re stupid.”
- Maintain a habit of seeking Non-Obvious insights
## The Content Pyramid
5 levels to becoming a legendary writer, creator, and “thought leader” in your field. 
**Level 1:** Consumption  
**Level 2:** Curation  
**Level 3:** Obvious Connection 
**Level 4:** Non-Obvious Connection 
**Level 5:** Category Creation 
### Roadmap up the Pyramid
1. **Active Consumption** to gain knowledge/ideas.
2. **Curation with Insight** to build credibility and grow an audience.
3. **Obvious Connections** to move the audience in mind paired with a topic from A to B, this is **demand capture**. The goal is to get attention and money quickly.
4. **Non-Obvious Connections** to change the world with your thinking, the is **demand creation**. The goal is to…(fill this blank spot of knowledge). 
5. **Category Creation** to become known for a niche you own while unlocking new business models. The reader is your **main character**, not you.
## Monetizing as a…
### Level 1 Consumer
Not possible.
### Level 2 Curator
Value (for them) is in saving time by trading attention in exchange for relevant information on a specific topic, aggregated and organized. What makes curation valuable is _the urgency, specificity, and importance_ of what is being curated. 

- Business Model: Attention and advertising
- Product: the audience
- Buyer: advertisers 
- Vehicle: the list
- You: Qur’an Ayat newsletter with Insights, read the Qur’an every year straight to your inbox. / Affirmations and positive feels books, quotes / Look at the information in your ChatGPT.
### Level 3 Obvious Creator
Value (for them) is when their “get” is greater then their “give” (engagement & money). You are selling access  (your niche, specialized, unique, differentiated content) to their relationship with you, and the value you provide them directly. This attention is harder to earn and what makes it more valuable. This is **Direct-to-Crestor**.

- Business Model: Your time and expertise as a product or service 
- Product: Your unique knowledge
- Buyer: your audience
- Vehicle: private network, worksheets, eBooks, membership, 1-on-1s
- You: Books, Courses, Speaking gigs, Digital products, Paid newsletter, Physical products, Mastermind groups, Bootcamps and workshops, QA consulting, etc. (reference ChatGPT)
### Level 4 Non-Obvious Creator
Value is in the transformations and experiences they receive. Still a Direct-to-Consumer, but the portfolio leans more into premium guru consulting, community driven courses, and outcome based services (consulting) and products. Your “value” as a creator is now in the thinking, and not the doing.

- Business Model: An experience/outcome gained from their time with you. 
- Product: Outcome/experience/transformation you provide
- Buyer: your audience
- Vehicle: Consultations, group courses, lectures, books, etc.
- You: Hidden wife workbook $12-20 (needs to be updated), pre-recorded video $200, join the live group work through of the book $500, personalized 1on1 $1000, coaching over time $20k, 

The goal here is to increase the value of your value by bringing the reader closer and closer to you, but using the same concepts. It’s the way it is being presented and personalized that increases the level of direct access and in turn the value.
### Level 5 Category Creator
The value is that the world sees you as the go-to for their problems. The key is that people have committed themselves and embraced your languaging. 

- Business Model: Category King, you give the people more and more of what they want.
- Product: Your movement
- Buyer: anyone who wants to join your movement
- Vehicle: Anything
- You: …

…your job—as a writer, but also as the marketer behind your movement—is to put “the right words” in “the right mouths.

That’s how you get people to talk about you and your work, solidify your Category King position, and build a legendary career that “pays for your party” for the rest of your life. 

This is the end goal, to BECOME THE DIFFERENCE.
## The Big 3 Content Marketing Lies
1. The most valuable form of marketing is your personal story.
2. Anything I say is valuable.
3. It’s all about how many people see my content.
### Getting your message out
Enabling the most influential people in your category to evangelize your POV is the fastest path to enduring, exponential growth. Which means your primary focus should NOT be to get “anyone” to hear your POV, but to leverage the attention and enthusiasm of your Superconsumers. Your job is to put the right words (your POV) in the right mouths (your Supers). 
### Do Not Confuse Strategy With Tactics
The last thing we want to point out here is the misunderstanding content marketers (and the companies who hire them) have between “strategy” and “tactics.” 

To put it simply:  
- **Strategy** = Which direction are you facing (are you going North or are you going South)?  
- **Tactics** = Once you know which direction you’re facing, how are you going to get there (by plane, by bus, by boat)? 

**Saying More By Doing Less**
What’s important is not “marketing tricks” or “growth hacks” that makes content stand out. It’s the conversations being had that push the thinking into uncharted territory. Think more about what it is you are saying and less about just saying things because you need to be heard. You need people to listen and consume you, that’s the goal.

**Art of Strategic (Fresh) Thinking**
It’s about knowing who you are talking to and the type of thinker they are reflexive (Obvious content) vs reflective (Non-Obvious content). 

> “Knowing who you are creating for, and what their expectations are (and why) is half the battle to becoming a legendary...”

**Strategy, in its purest form, is the art of the possible.** 
It’s the process of considering “what could be true.”
- What new mental model would have to be invented for this to work? 
- What if people moved _from_ the way it is, _to_ a new and different way? 
- What if a new outcome (an outcome we haven’t considered before) was possible? 
## How To Create Obvious & Non-Obvious Content
In order to build the skill of coming up with fresh, new ideas, we have to first define what it means to “think.” 

And here’s why:  
**Obvious Content** = The art of speaking to what people already think and believe (catering to the reader’s _reflexive_ nature).  
**Non-Obvious Content** = The art of educating people on what they haven’t thought about or decided they believe yet (requesting their _reflective_ nature). 

In order to sell your ideas you need to communicate the value of each idea in a clear and concise manner. It doesn’t matter to your audience if you use 6, 600, or 6’000 words. They only care about is the problem you are solving, the solution you are providing, and the outcome you are unlocking against their perceived benefits and their own expectations.

- “If I believe this problem you’re framing is real, then how bad has my life been with this unknown problem lingering for so long?”
- “If I use this solution, how much more effective will I be in solving this problem?”
- “If I unlock this outcome, how am I different? What will my life be like?” 
### 4 stages of creation:
- **Least Valuable:** Obvious, Obvious
- **More Valuable Near-Term:** Obvious, Non-Obvious
- **More Valuable Long-Term:** Non-Obvious, Obvious
- **Too Complicated:** Non-Obvious, Non-Obvious 
### Examples in Use
#### Obvious, Non-Obvious

**[[Obvious Problem]]**: I want to get into real estate so I have some passive revenue. 

**[[Non-Obvious Solution]]**: Don’t buy buildings and be a landlord. Keep your money, and instead rent an attractive apartment and charge a premium by renting it out again on Airbnb (while you crash on your buddy’s couch). 

**[[Obvious Outcome]]:** I have passive revenue without having to invest big money to get started. 
#### Non-Obvious, Obvious
**[[Non-Obvious Problem]]**: Office coffee sucks even though it is free— because not everyone likes the same kind of coffee. 

**[[Obvious Solution]]:** Here’s a single-serve cup of coffee in a tiny K-Cup so you can choose the specific roast, blend, origin and flavor just the way you like it. 

**[[Non-Obvious Outcome]]:** Employees are happier with the coffee and employers are psyched that their workforce is more productive because they are well caffeinated and do not have to leave to go to Starbucks.
### Languaging to…
The use of words to own ideas. 
- Niche down: declaring a deeper subcategory or subject
- Name and Claim an idea: claiming an old concept or idea with new words
- Invent a new term: inventing new words for ownership
### Generating Non-Obvious Ideas
To make Obvious content seem Non-Obvious is by using Languaging.

The real question is how to come up with Non-Obvious ideas. 
- How do you spot Non-Obvious problems?
- How do you create Non-Obvious solutions?
- How do you unlock Non-Obvious outcomes? 

Non-Obvious insights are about solving equations with no known/understood variables. They occur at the intersection of two or more conflicting data points or perspectives. They must be held in your mind long enough for your mental model to consider, “What must be true?”
### How to Spot, Create, Unlock Non-Objective problems, solutions, and outcomes…**

- What are the solutions most highly valued by society today?
- What problems do those solutions create?
- And how can you be the first (or close to the first) to solve those emerging problems? 
### The 5 Archetypes for People who create Non-Obvious ideas in the world.
- **You are a Superconsumer:** You are passionate about something, and so you understand your own problems better than anyone else.
- **You are a Category Designer:** You can frame solutions to problems people didn’t know they had. 
- **You are a Languager:** You can use language to transform a rational problem into an emotional one by “calling” it something.
- **You are a Visionary:** You can visualize Non-Obvious outcomes few people believe are possible. 
- **You are a Missionary:** You are already living in the future, and will excitedly knock on people’s doors in an effort to “spread the good word.” 
## The Power of a Point of View

Your POV is the script customers use in word-of-mouth marketing. A POV bound to the way things already are, then you have just signed yourself up for a lifetime of competition before your journey has even started. 

> POVs move the world from the way it is to a new, different way. Everything is the way it is because somebody changed the way it was. 

This needs to be engineered in a way that gets people talking, it makes you different. You need your content to empower word of mouth amongst your audience. Make legendary content, not legendary volume. It’s about moving people into a new direction and giving them lightening strike moments of thought.

If you are leading them in the same direction as everyone else, you are part of the noise. The only way to not be part of the noise is to, quite literally, _not_ say the same thing and _not_ lead their thinking in the same direction.

**You MUST reject the premise.** 
## Questions to Answer
Below are the answers to the questions put forward by the book [Snow Leopard by Category Pirates](applenotes:note/3102f7bb-0bc8-499f-a901-b96f30435b2e?ownerIdentifier=_1980de358b03e982aae912d5351da40e) to get your creator business up and running. 
### Monetization: Your Burn Rate
**Question** **#1****:** What does the party cost? CHF 6-8k or USD 7-9k. 
**Question #2:** And who is the party for? For the survival and care of my family.

### Writer Business Goals: What are you solving for? 
- **Question:** What outcome you are solving for in monetizing your writing: 
	- Are you solving for money?
	- Are you solving for time?
	- Are you solving for status?
	- Are you solving for contribution/impact? 

My writing is **solving for money**.
### Fork in the Road: Obvious vs Non-Obvious Monetization
**Obvious content is Actionable.** The clearest tell is when the content says “How To” do something. Most “How To” is Obvious, incremental, and linear: “Want to achieve X? Here’s how to move from A to B.” 

**Non-Obvious content is Thinking.** It’s the reason “Why” something works, happens, functions, etc. “Why” content is Non-Obvious and meandering because understanding requires context and the connection of disparate and oftentimes conflicting or polar opposite data points. As a result, Non-Obvious content is more complicated than Obvious content, but also more timeless and exponential. 

**Question** **#1****:** Which game do you want to play?  
- The “actionable” game? 
- Or the “thinking” game? 

I am playing the "thinking" game, but need to start in the “actionable” game at 80-90% (primary) with the “thinking” game at 10-20% (secondary) of the production.

**Question #2:** What type of content do you enjoy creating the most?
- In-person talks
- Live streams
- Writing
- Digital via my laptop/phone
- Travelling to industry events

Primarily writing, talking head video, and live streams.

**Question** **#3****:** Where are your Superconsumers?
- TikTok and YouTube
- Twitter
- Forums like Reddit and Quora

**Question** **#4****:** Another way to figure this out is by what you are a Superconsumer of? 

I am a Superconsumer of: trauma healing, self-therapy, childhood wounds, Islamic character building, Islamic cleansing of the heart, Islamic psychology/philosophy, fundamentals of the Qur’an, men’s development, mental and emotional health, power/relationship dynamics, being creative, practicing as a visual artist, productivity and habits, communication and leadership skills.

- Which of these Mediums are you a Super of? 
  eBooks, YouTube videos, live video conversations
- Are you a Native Analog or Native Digital? 
  Native Digital
- Where do you “hang out” physically or digitally? 
  Digitally: Reddit, X, TikTok, YouTube
- What sort of relationships do you value most? 
  Intimate and communal ones where you get to know each other beyond just a title.
- If you wanted to meet more people “like you,” where would you go? 
  YouTube, Reddit, search for online groups doing healing work/personal development/manhood/marriage stuff, I might even look into Facebook, and Discord. Basically places that give me more direct interaction with a community.
### Define your POV
**Question #1:** **What are you actually saying?** The world is a mess and the only solution is to create healthy families which in turn make healthy communities. It begins with addressing the trauma. Basically, self-healing of survivors for family and community must be the priority. 

- **Which direction are you leading people’s thinking?** Better future families through trauma healing of the men and prioritization of boys education and safety (Rights of Passage).

**Question #2: What is the transformation as a result of adopting this POV?** Becoming emotionally sound and family/community driven people with an improved state of empathy and prioritization of intimate relationships.

- When someone follows your line of thinking, where do they end up? They end up free, sovereign in their mind, no longer suffering for trauma and bad relationships.
- Do they experience a plastic-y, incremental outcome, or an exponential one? Exponential outcomes of devastating shifts.
- On a scale of 1 to 10, how DIFFERENT is their life (and/or business) before & after listening to, digesting, and internalizing your new POV? 8 being very different from dating to courtship, self-destructive to productive.

**Question #3: How can you get your Superconsumers to hear & adopt your POV?** 

Hearing…
- Host lives speaking about the importance of my POV and the future it represents
- Rally amongst people who also share similar or adjacent points of view 
- Speak on and against the “enemy” of my point of view (confirmation bias)

Adopt the POV…
- Make a clear stance on what you do not accept to be true and who you do not stand with, better yet who you stand against 
- Provide educational resources to better understand why my point of view is important
- Provide solutions to the problems that my “enemy” is giving people from my point of view 
- Infuse spiritual grounding and communal ties to the messaging

### Saying More By Doing Less
**If you are a CEO or founder,** what is your differentiated insight? Aimless dating is the root of much of our problems, because our core purpose as humans is not being fulfilled. We’ve become soulless and lost. The lack of boundaries in men destroys our aility to connect and build/protect sustainable communities.

- What problem are you solving? The lack of guidance in overcoming past traumas, improving communication, and fostering emotional resilience to create more fulfilling connections with themselves and others.
- Why do you care (like all missionaries do) about your category, company, and products? I care about my category because there’s a lack of accessibility for people and missing representation for the black community. The company matters because it will allow me to work in my God-given purpose. The products matter because they represent my legacy, it what will be left after I die.
- Why should others care? Others should care because the amount of people running around wounded and wounding others is a problem for our society and the raising of children (more abuse moving into the next generation).
- What difference are you trying to make for others? For others to live free of the cage of emotional trauma that leads them into living empty lives chasing fleeting acceptance and destroying their soul and others in the process. Bring back honour and the family unit in the black community.
### Rejecting the Premise
Human being respond to POVs. “In order to change the world, and unlock exponential breakthroughs, you have to reject the premise.”

An easy way of understanding whether you are accepting or rejecting the premise is by questioning whether you are Forecasting or Backcasting. 

**Question #1:** Which direction are you facing?
- **Forecasting**: Standing in the past, looking forward, thinking about the future.
- **Backcasting**: Standing in a different future, and living “as if “ that different future already exists today.

I am definitely **backcasting** (and then educating people on the new and different benefits that get unlocked as a result. Did this in my lives somewhat.)

**Question #2:** Do our category’s customers have “Stockholm Syndrome”? Can we set them free? 

My category’s customers feel imprisoned and comforted by it. Yes, we can definitely set them free. They are locked into a cycle of fear and mistrust of the unknown potentially grounded in colonization.

**Question #3**: If [[Michael Lewis]], [[Malcolm Gladwell]], [[Doris Kearns Goodwin]], and [[Bob Woodward]] wrote a book about your category... what would they say? 
- [ ] Look up who the above mentioned people are.
- **What truths would they uncover?** Trauma in boys results in trauma for all. Men are the only one’s that can show black women there’s nothing to fear. The lies about who men are that women believe. Men inherently are left severely uneducated and trained in EQ.
- **Who would be their heroes and villains?** The villains would be themselves, the ignored wounded selves. The hero’s would also be the healed self.
- **What might they write that would make all the incumbents hang their heads in shame?** The truth needs to be said. That as men we are in control and blaming black women is a foolish endeavour.
- **What could they write that might bring us to tears of gratitude that someone noticed?** That as a man your mind, body, and soul is enough and worthy of being cherish. [[You Are Not Disposable by Dwayne Cyrus|You are not disposable]](work on this now!). This is your book or tape or something, this is the movement! 
- **What would the verdict of history be?** That my works and those that follow has bettered the black man and reunited the black family into a self-sustaining force and spiritually grounded economy.

**Question #4:** What is your POV? Write it.
Answer: Black boundaries in men create black connected families.

Legendary POVs have a simple architecture. Show customers how your “solution” bridges the gap from the problem/opportunity to the different future. 

- Frame a different problem/opportunity. 
- Evangelize a different future.
- Write your tagline.

What creates the category is your new and different POV.  
And what crystalizes your POV is Languaging.  
This is how people “get” what you’re talking about.  
Everything else is just _better/faster/cheaper/smarter/stronger_ noise. 

Answer the above question of #3.
- Black boundaries in men create black connected families.
- Defined boundaries create tight communities)
- **Boundaries for Connection**

“Boundaries for Connection” says everything, it’s my life’s work and is the core to everything else!
