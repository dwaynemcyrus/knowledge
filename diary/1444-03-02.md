## 1543
I am going through another sundering and shattering of my mind and beliefs the first was my remembrance of Islam, and this is the second the acceptance of the reality of who i am, who Dwayne is. 

My heart is heavy, my mind is tearing apart with clarity, vision, and focus. A pathway forward is coming into existence and it hurts to bear, it hurts to recognize that I have living and facilitating a lie. The lie that who i am was never enough, never worth embracing, and that I needed to chase the non-existent approval, appreciation, and validation of my very own mother. 

it sickens me to my core, that I have been this all of my life. 34 years on this planet I have sought after this, hunted it, begged for it, pleaded, for it, betrayed myself for it. Only to be nothing but a ghost of my true self, a facade, a fake, and empty vessel filled with potential and nothing more.

I am done. — 1548.
