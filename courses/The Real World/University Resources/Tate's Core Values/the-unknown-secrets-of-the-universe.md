## Summary 

## Highlights

## Notes
- The universe is all around us and we can squeeze it to give us everything we need and want
- Every action has an equal and opposite reaction, so if you act, it must react like Islam tie your camel 
- Force your energy into the universe, it will respond
- Always think about what energy am I putting into the universe, before you do anything.
