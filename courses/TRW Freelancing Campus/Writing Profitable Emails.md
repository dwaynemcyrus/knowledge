## Before We Monetize

- Remember you are not just talking to a pixel, but you are helping a person solve problems, pain points
- The more you work the craft, the more confident you will become
- Never forget you are talking to another human being on the other side of the screen you must always provide value
- Always think what are your readers goals and problems
- When you are monetizing it is your job to actually help them
