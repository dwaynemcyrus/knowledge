## A Champions Doubt
- The mountain of success is all about pain and doubt
- You’ll never know if something will work until it’s actually working
- Deep doubt about what you are doing is natural and occurs in every champion
- If you do what you need to do everyday, and know the what and why of your doing logically you can dismiss your doubts
- The average person gets hit with doubts and always quits when the fatigue hits
- Work as hard as you can everyday
- You will always find doubts on the way up, and when you have them you still do the work instead of searching for clarity
- When you are winning everything is easy
- 99.99999% of people will always quit
- Do what you say you are going to do everyday so that you do not loose momentum 
- Even when you are sad, you get the job done 

## Billionaires are All the Same
- Daily goals are the only goals that matter
- Daily goes ensure you do what must be done
- Weekly, monthly, quarterly goals mean nothing
- Each day the goal is to do just a bit better than the last day, the number must go up
- Success compounds
- Business is exponential, but once you take off you fly. The most energy is required to get off the ground
- It’s all about execution, what are you doing every single day
- Work/life balance doesn’t exist, every day is work, sleep is work, health is work, everything is work 24/7

## Don’t Become a Geek in Chaos
- Your health is the most important thing in the world 
- You must workout every single day
- Success means there’s always something to do, the work does not end
- All the riches are worthless if you do not maintain your physical health everyday
- The chaos of the path to success often turn us into geeks who look weird and can’t socialize 
- Even if you must quit the boot camp or reduce your work, you must maintain your health

## Spell Casting 101
- Never speak negative words on yourself, what you say and think shape who you ate
- The words out your mouth should always be practical and positive
- Never say anything that you do not want to be! 
- Never caste these spells on others
- “I’m weak right now, and will fix it” vs “I am fat”
- When you believe who you are you will work hard to be sure it’s true as anything else will hurt

## Mindset on Life
- Only ask and think about questions that will effect and change what you do

## Your Brain is Trying to Make You a Loser
- The answer to is this a good idea is to try it
- The brain is designed to be lazy/efficient 
- We live in a world of unlimited energy, because we have food
- Is there any downside risk in my action I want to take? No, so take it
- Be an anti-thinker, because your brain is always trying to stop you
- Time risk and energy risk means nothing in relation to trying your idea if it take you one days work
- Brokie brains say I don’t want to waste my time 
- If the risk fails, take 20 minutes to learn why it failed
- The basic programming says don’t waste energy and time ie. don’t work out this wastes calories, building muscle expends more energy
- Your brain doesn’t understand you have unlimited energy (food)
- Burn the time, test the ideas, reality will tell you if your ideas is good or not 

## Reality is Beautiful
- $1k a day with extremely hard work in a year of dedicated work of marketing and sales, you’ll be making more than a doctor in 1/5 the time
- People make money by selling and marketing things, this is everything 
- If you want to make more money you need to talk to more people

## Tenacity
- 24 hours a day everyday on a single goal is the win
- Success is a matter of time as long you are consciously working and thinking
- Your first few months will be zero results while you learn and solve the problem
- Marketing and sales is a skill and you must use your brain
- No matter how low or dumb or whatever you are behind in as long as you work daily you will win
- There’s no reason you can’t do what someone else is currently doing
- It’s about putting in the hours to learn and train to being to know how to get people to give me money

## Lucid Dreaming
- This is about how to dream about work
- Dreams are just you processing your thoughts from the day
- Your brain is saving and clearing the knowledge, thoughts, and experiences of the day when you sleep
- You will only solve the problems of the things you want to solve the most, so you must be focused on what you think about while awake
- Before sleep while in bed think of your core problems only and how to solve them. In bed when you get a solution write it in phone and repeat
- So what do you think about? Your daily goal list.
- Immediately reject any thoughts that are not on your list in order to become world class
