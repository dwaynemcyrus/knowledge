I am building my coaching program (paid) that will be the core of my offer which in turn expands out to my private community (paid) which then is expanded out to my public community (free). 

Today, I will listen to you. I will submit. I just need one final bit of confirmation that this is the right direction for me to take care of myself and my family. If you give the go ahead I will start the business today and go public today.

The business is to build a communal education and coaching around boundaries for survivors of trauma that are marriage minded and god fearing who are already actively engaged in personal development. 

The revenue is as follows:
- Community Membership (stabilizer)
- Digital education products (builder)
- Consulting/Coaching (core)

How does this put me in a spot to serve you?
By working with women of trauma from divorce and men who are seeking to be confident leaders, I can create an ecosystem of people who can come together marry and break the cycles of trauma. 

The core offering is boundaries (connection) after trauma (disconnection) which show up in various ways.
- Spouses (the way you establish and maintain bonds)
- Career (what and how you earn a living)
- Self (how you treat yourself)
- Friends (the way you bond with others)
- Community (the way you serve others)

4x a week group sessions private for $100 QnA with some tools usually paid for free. A small group capped aiming for workshop with rotated subjects. 12x a month at 3 times a week.

The philosophy is boundary for connection.
The people are marriage minded survivors on their voyage to thriving.
The reason is to get people grounded and empowered emotionally for fulfilling relationships with others and themselves.

The business needs to operate on my writing alone as the sales tool and require me not to have to do sales. The people come to me organically. 

Ya Allah SWT this is the last time I’m going to do this because I am going to make this business profitable, this week! I’ll also do ghostwriting on the side as a part time to give me more income and to train my writing okay.

**It’s time…Coach, Creator, and part-time ghostwriter & illustrator.**
## The Response
Open The Dawn
113:5 I know this Ayat is about protection, so my first thought was I need to stop looking at what other people have and what they are doing and just focus on what I need to do.
113:1-5 Surah Spread only good, this is Allah SWT providing you with healing, Ruqya perhaps.

First The Constellations 
85:10 You have been in mental anguish, and this is of your own doing to yourself. The thinking and not doing kind. Now, it is on you to repent for this a do differently which is to start the work.
85:7-13 Doing this work can be a part of your repentance to Allah SWT for being disrespectful to your body and soul and not being grateful for the gifts you have been blessed with to serve others.

Second The Repentance 
9:128 You have been given a messenger and you need to follow in his lead, this is the work that you do my brother. Do it like the prophet! You have an example of to do Dawah, get to it.
9:125-129 You need to read 129 every single day, after every Salah and do the damn work! Become the man everyone sees you as, it is time! Allah SWT will take care of the rest.

Third The Mount
52:41 I don’t know or understand this one.
52:38-44 This is your test to believe in Allah SWT and work hard! Allah SWT has given to you everything that you need! Now make it work. This is your hill to climb, no one else but you can do it! DO. NOT BE LIKE THE DISBELIEVERS. Believe in the work Allah SWT has shown you to do.

Close The Prohibition
66:4 You are protected by Allah SWT and the Angels and any who are against you need to worry about themselves, you just maintain doing the work.
66:1-7 Weird side note just so it is said, I want two wives. But more importantly I am stopping myself from what Allah SWT has said is good for me to do for me. You are not alone I. Your work, you have a community of people who believe in you, now you need to show them what they believed in her to stay and true. Work for the believers! Be like the prophets and guide the people. 
## The Takeaways 
Allah SWT has given me the ground rules of my work…and my work I will begin. Alhamdulillah, boundaries for connection!
