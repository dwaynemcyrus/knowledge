## Notes
**What they Should feel**

-   Email is recommended over DM whenever possible 
-   Cold outreach needs to be about them and what they care about, not you
-   You are not the leader they are not the follower you are equals
-   The feeling needs to be you are cool I am cool let’s see how we can work together
-   The feelings needs to be personal, a friend communicating with a friend to help them

  

**Different Cold Outreach Email Strategies** 

-   Pick a strategy that feels right for you from the options given
-   Stick with one and work it until it has truly failed or succeeded
-   I prefer the indirect method with “Complete Honesty” or the high probability selling
-   The “High Probability Selling” appeals to me as it filters through the people who are in the buying window.
-   The direct methods are straight to the point which I like as I know what I am doing.
-   Indirect method of Free Value is also a good way to position one’s self
-   For you lean on your past expertise while offering the free value with honesty 
-   The dream 100 process is good for building your network especially through DMs on the side of the cold emails

  

  

**The importance of making your outreach unique to you**

-   DO NOT copy paste the templates as they will not work.
-   You need to do this YOUR WAY, hunt the way that works for you.
-   Your copy needs to match your brand voice

  

**Testing Plan**

-   Make an email machine to get a high response rate such as 10 leads making 2 responses
-   You need to get an 80-90-% open rate and you do this by sending 40 emails each day and every 10 will have its own subject line. Repeat until you hit 80%.
-   Take your 80% percent open rate and begin to test your body copy until you hit your 10-20% response rate.  

  

**How to Create Winning Subject Lines**

-   Subject lines are not the same as marketing subject lines
-   The subject line needs to be like a subject line you would send to a friend, “quick question”
-   Subject line needs to be between 1-5 words max
-   You want to bait and switch, have them be curious about what is behind the message
-   You must get an 80% open rate because if you don’t the prospecting you are doing goes to waste. If your open rate is 30%, 70% of your prospecting is wasted.

  

**How to Create Winning Email Body Messages**

-   Pick one template and optimize it
-   A very specific compliment keeps the reader and it must be specific and personal, it must only apply to them
-   You compliment must not come off like a fanboy, and you come across as a peer and never below them.
-   Position yourself as your an expert at what you do and I’m an expert at what I do, “I like what you did with X and I can the impact is make for Y” as your compliment.
-   1-2 sentences max for your compliment, nothing more. 
-   Another driver of success is that you need to tease something, build curiosity. Remember information gap!
-   CTA must be made easy, “Interested? Y/N” “Want to get on a quick 5-10 minute call this week?” 
-   Overview: personalization > curiosity > CTA

  

**Compliments**

-   Reasons: to do it’s an excellent way of human interaction, it’s a recognition of who they are and what they do.
-   Reasons: It gives you an opportunity to let them know this email is specific to them and only relevant to them.
-   The compliment should never make sense for any other person.
-   The compliment must speak to the owner and their audience, it positions you as a professional, “I like that you do X for your clients”.
-   Compliment them on the content they create specifically as they spend great time and effort making it.
-   When you compliment, you need to actually care about the person’s business and what they do. This will come across in your writing.
-   A simple and genuine compliment is what you need to do.
