## Subconscious Surfacing
**Artwork**
- The logo for Cyrus is a horizontal “H” sitting on top of right-turn “C” in a design inspired by Japanese characters. 
- Take your every days artwork posters and make them into prints for the names of Allah and sell them, also include wallpaper packs as well and put each name into a a few backgrounds of their own. Have beautifully typeset versions in English as well using the same font for Nonstop Muslims.
- Make your personal quote “I am born Muslim. I live Muslim. I will die Muslim.” into an account exclusive prints with a painting you have done in the Orient style. Consider making it into a three panel piece for prints. Perhaps similar to the image below of Salahuddin.

- Sell service condensing information into IG slides and TikTok slides
**Content**

- Use the TikTok image templates to promote your artwork.
- Nonstop Muslim is your voice on Muslim specific issues along side motivational talks, consider these your own little Khutbas (Did I spell this right?)
- Women cutting themselves and self-harm to guilt men into stay, why is this so effective
- Expose all the knowledge you have about women, like you do with [[q-nova|QNova]] 
- Women don’t care about mens body count many of you will know a man is sleeping with many women and will be curious to to know what the other women are experiencing that you aren’t it’s FOMO and pre selection by social proof
