Tier 4 Onboarding Covenant — The Drill Deck

Status: Active | Client-Facing (after payment)**

Note: Covenant for men entering the Drill Deck. Sets tone, rules, and expectations.

  

⸻

  

Welcome

  

This is not a casual group.

It is naval training under watch.

  

By stepping onto the Deck, you agree to show up, cut drift out of your life, and accept correction without resistance.

  

If you’re looking for comfort, casual chat, or soft accountability — leave now.

  

If it feels heavy — good. That means the discipline has found you. Presence is required.

  

If you walk away, you do so knowing the Deck stands:

• No refunds.

• No re-entry without approval.

• The drills keep moving without you.

  

This is your training ground.

Not comfort. Not chatter. The Deck drills presence into you.

  

⸻

  

Structure

  

You were not added — you were admitted.

• Initiation Call (2 Hours): Mandatory rite of entry. Sets your foundation: rules, training focus, and expectations. Required before you enter the Drill Deck thread.

• Drill Deck Thread (Telegram): Private channel. Drift is exposed and cut out here. No noise, no excuses.

• Weekly Prompts: Tactical reflections and execution challenges.

• Monthly Training Arcs: Each month the Deck trains one focus — a shared campaign of discipline applied across family, business, and presence. You are not given content. You are pressed into practice.

• Brotherhood Challenges: Proof over talk. Drift is exposed here.

• The Armory: Tactical videos, PDFs, and audio teachings.

  

⸻

  

Asynchronous Support

• You can submit reflections, questions, or challenges at any time.

• Replies delivered within 72 hours during Office Hours (Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday).

• Your submissions must be clear, disciplined, and direct. Rambling is ignored.

  

Ask wisely. Speak with intention.

  

I do not respond outside these parameters — not out of avoidance, but because guidance must be delivered with discipline, not noise.

  

This is correction and command.

  

⸻

  

Core Principles

• No drift. No ghosting. Presence required.

• Proof over talk.

• The Deck drills excuses out of you.

• You are corrected, not coddled.

• Silence is welcome. Speak with direction, not noise.

  

⸻

  

Rules of Engagement

• You train here as a brother, not as a spectator.

• You accept correction without defense.

• You confront drift when you see it — in yourself and others.

• If you drift or violate the standard, you are removed, clean.

• Re-entry is only at my sole discretion.

  

This is not punishment.

This is protection — of the Deck, the men, and the work.

  

⸻

  

Terms & Commitment

• Ongoing access at 1’200 CHF/month

• Cancel only before next billing cycle

• Fixed capacity: 36 men maximum

• Application required — this is curated discipline, not a public group

• Payment: Stripe. No refunds. No discounts.

• Initiation Call (Mandatory): Required before you are admitted into the Drill Deck thread. Non-refundable. Without it, you do not enter.

  

⸻

  

Final Reminder

  

This is not therapy.

This is not release.

This is naval drilling that forges men into presence.

  

There is no “joining” here. Only arriving under watch.

  

Every man on this Deck has made a decision:

To stop waiting. To stop performing. To stop collapsing.

  

And to start drilling himself into command.

  

If you hold presence, you will be sharpened.

If you drift, you will be cut out.

  

The Deck is sacred.

Step on accordingly.
