## Summary

## Handouts
The Gameplan

Only two things matter in business.

1) How do we grow our audience and become well known.

2) What do we sell and how do we monetise our audience.

Every business is just these two parts.

Most businesses fail because they never get people's attention.

They never grow an audience.

Growing an audience and becoming well known

The hardest part of business is growing an audience and gathering attention.

This is why you will be using the Tate Cheatcode.

The goal is $500 in 30 days.

That means you need every advantage possible.

Tate is very easy to market for because of a few things.

1) He's a great entertaining speaker.

2) He's multifaceted.

Tate has been on interviews.

He races super cars.

He's a world class fighter.

He travels all over the world.

And is constantly surrounded by beautiful women.

He's an interesting person with a variety of clips and scenarios which we have an archive of for you to use.

It is very easy to make an interesting person viral

It is NOT easy to make a normal person viral.

This is why we work with Tate clips and abuse The Tate cheatcode.

They make growing accounts and followings easy.

Students who have been under me for months can get 10,000 followers on TikTok within 2 days using Tate Clips.

Your goal is 10,000 TikTok followers within 21 days.

What do we sell and how do we monetise our audience?

So, within 21 days you'll have over 10,000 people following your accounts.

They'll be watching your posts, liking, commenting and overall enjoying what you put out.

They follow you for a reason.

As we will teach you throughout the bootcamp,

They follow you because you've made their life better.

You are a positive force on their life.

So when you show a clip of Tate endorsing a product and you direct them where to purchase it,

They are very likely to buy

This is how you will be monetising your audience.

By selling Tate's products using Tate's image and receiving 50% of the purchase price.

I have an important note of add which will be the difference between yourself being successful or a failure in business.

Be a Good for the World

The key to success is to become a force for good on the world.

When you make your $500, it will be because you brought real world value to people.

They followed you account because YOU curated and chose the most valuable and entertaining Tate clips possible.

They bought because YOU showed them Tate advice that changed their life for the better.

So when you show them a video of Tate promoting a product, they know they can trust him and you and buy it.

If you do not believe in the product Tate is selling, you shouldn't sell it.

You must be true to your heart about what you sell.

You NEED to truly believe that you are a positive force on the world.

THAT is the only way to be successful.

I will explain the phenomena later in the bootcamp.

You will also be introduced to your list of products we recommend selling later in the bootcamp.
