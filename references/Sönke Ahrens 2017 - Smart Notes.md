P.07 - We write to organize our thoughts and the share them with others be it ideas or quotes. Fear of forgetting what is important to us is key to why we write notes.

P.07 - “Every intellectual endeavour starts with a note.”

P.09 - “Writing is not what follows research, learning or studying, it is the medium of all this work.”

P.09 - Note-taking lacks immediate negative feedback making it difficult to improve or see the issues in our process.

P.10 - Uncertainty of how and where start a piece of writing — the black screen — pushes people to self-help books.

P.10 - Negative mantras like, “Some people are just like that,” “writing has to be difficult,” “the struggle is part of the deal” stop people from investigating what makes a successful writing strategy from a poor one.

P.12 - “The quality of a paper and the ease with which it is written depends more than anything on *what you have done in writing before you even made a decision on the topic*.”

P.12 - The key to success in life and in writing is preparation.

P.13 - “What *does* make a significant difference along the whole intelligence spectrum is something else: how much self-discipline or self-control one uses to approach the tasks at hand (Duckworth and Seligman, 2005; Tangney, Baumeister, and Boone, 2004).”

P.13 - “It is not so important who you are, but what you do.”

P.13 - “Self-discipline or self-control is not that easy to achieve with willpower alone. Willpower is, as far as we know today, a limited resource that depletes quickly and is also not that much up for improvement over the long term (Baumeister, Bratslavsky, Muraven, and Tice, 1998; Muraven, Tice, and Baumeister, 1998; Schmeichel, Vohs, and Baumeister, 2003; Moller, 2006”

P.14 - “We know today that self-control and self-discipline have much more to do with our environment than with ourselves (cf. Thaler, 2015, ch. 2) – and the environment can be changed. 

P.14 - Willpower is not needed when temptation is not around such as a chocolate that is not there. And willpower is not needed when you want to do something.

P.14 - Having a well-defined task that is meaningful removes any conflict between long- and short-term interests and that defeats willpower every time.
#### Ch.01: Everything You Need to Know
P.15 - “so he could honestly say: “I never force myself to do anything I don’t feel like. Whenever I am stuck, I do something else.” A good structure allows you to do that, to move seamlessly from one task to another – without threatening the whole arrangement or losing sight of the bigger picture.”

P.15 - A good structure prevents the burden of you from having to remember everything, but for this to work you have to trust the system.

P.15 - “A good structure enables flow, the state in which you get so completely immersed in your work that you lose track of time and can just keep on going as the work becomes effortless (Csikszentmihalyi, 1975).”

P.16 - Plans make you inflexible and imposes a structure for you to work in. This forced you to employ willpower to stick to it and is not suitable for creative work which is an open ended process. This gets in the way of us experiencing the unexpected like new ideas, discoveries, and insights.

P.17 - Students are planners and experts are explorers with a structure that supports their open-ended works.

P.19 - “In psychology, this is known as the [[Dunning-Kruger effect]] (Kruger and Dunning, 1999”

P.19 - “…those who are not very good at something tend to be overly confident, while those who have made an effort tend to underestimate their abilities.”

P.20 - Good students constantly raise the bar to reach what they have not learned or mastered yet. 

P.20 - “This is why high achievers who have had a taste of the vast amount of knowledge out there are likely to suffer from what psychologists call imposter syndrome, the feeling that you are not really up to the job, even though, of all people, they are (Clance and Imes 1978; Brems et al. 1994”

P.20 - “Good solutions are simple and unexpected.”

P.22 - People want to reduce complexity by over-organizing. The true solution is to keep things simple and follow a few hard principles. 

P.22 - “The simplicity of the structure allows complexity to build up where we want it: on the content level. There is quite extensive empirical and logical research on this phenomenon (for an overview: cf. Sull and Eisenhardt, 2015).”

P.22 - “It is not about redoing what you have done before, but about changing the way of working from now on. ”

P.23 - The best tools meaningless if they are not used within a proper routine that supports sustained growth and productivity.

P.23 - “Routines require simple, repeatable tasks that can become automatic and fit together seamlessly (cf. Mata, Todd, and Lippke, 2010).”

P.24 - “Only when all the related work becomes part of an overarching and interlocked process, where all bottlenecks are removed, can significant change take place (which is why none of the typical “10 mind-blowing tools to improve your productivity” tips you can find all over the internet will ever be of much help).”

P.24 - “The importance of an overarching workflow is the great insight of David Allen’s “Getting Things Done” (Allen, 2001)”

P.24 - To let go and focus on what needs to be done now, we need to everything from the most important to least is taken cared of. To remove all and any lingering worries and thoughts is what brings us to a state of “mind like water” — to work without distracting thoughts. This is the principle from [[David Allen]]’s GTD system. 

P.26 - Writing like healing is not a linear process and writing is a requirement for healing. Make an essay about this. 

P.28 - [[Niklas Luhmann]] the guy who created the Zettlekasten in other words the slip-box system what this book is about. 

P.29 - [[Helmut Schelsky]] one of the most well regarded sociologists in Germany who planted the seed for Luhmann to teach sociology at the [[University of Bielefeld]].

P.31 - laconically

P.31 - “The Society of Society” (1997)”

P.31 - epistemology

P.32 - “If I want something, it’s more time. The only thing that really is a nuisance is the lack of time.” (Luhmann, Baecker, and Stanitzek, 1987, 139) ” — write about the importance of time. 

P.33 - [[Johannes F.K. Schmidt]] a sociology researcher who studied Luhmann’s work. 

P.34 - Writing and potentially other open-ended works need not be forced. They are best done when one knows what to write and the moment one stops knowing what to do they must stop and change focus. 

P.35 - Hard work can be fun when it is in alignment with our intrinsic goals and we *feel* in control. We become frustrated and arrested with our work when there is no flexibility to adjust as our work develops on its own. To stay in control is to keep your options open while in process of the work. This requires our work environment to be flexible  enough to handle adjustments so we do not struggle with resistance.

P.35 - “Only if the work is set up in a way that is flexible enough to allow these small and constant adjustments can we keep our interest, motivation and work aligned – which is the precondition to effortless or almost effortless work.”

P.36 - “success is not the result of strong willpower and the ability to overcome resistance, but rather the result of smart working environments that avoid resistance in the first place (cf. Neal et al. 2012; Painter et al. 2002; Hearn et al. 1998). Instead of struggling with adverse dynamics, highly productive people deflect resistance, very much like judo champions. This is not just about having the right mindset, it is also about having the right workflow.”

P.38 - Simple ideas produce impressive results. Always KISS — keep it super simple.

P.38 - [[Henry Ford]]

P.39 - The slip box has is split into 2 components the bibliographic box with reference notes on the content of consumed media and the main which stored ideas in response to the reference notes and spontaneous ideas.

P.39-42 - Steps of the slipbox
1. After writing brief notes he would reflect on each one for any relevance to his own thinking and writings
2. He would write any thoughts comments and ideas into the main box using on side of an A6 holding a single idea in full sentences and explicit references
3. After writing a note he would look through previous notes for potential connections and link them as direct or indirect.
4. Lastly, he would create an index system linking entry points to a topic or train of thought, somewhat like a [[map of content]] (MOC).

P.43 - “We need a reliable and simple external structure to think in that compensates for the limitations of our brains.”

P.44
- “Everybody is motivated when the finish line is within reach. ”

P.37
- Assemble notes and place them in order to start your draft of any new work. This is much more fun and easy on the brain, it’s playful. A play is great for producing successful work.
- Thinking, reading, learning/understanding, and coming up with new ideas is the main work. Not the note taking, not the writing. Always have a pen and paper on hand if you want to improve long term.

- Writing is the requirement to best understand, learn, and ensure our thoughts are clear.

P.39-43
Steps to writing a paper
1. Always have something at hand to capture thoughts, a voice recorder, journal, paper and pen, phone apps these are fleeting notes and are meant to be discarded daily at most.
2. Make reference notes on what you read, anything you don’t want to forget and what you want to use in the future writing, that it. Keep it very short, selective, and in your own words.
3. Process your fleeting and reference notes and think about how they relate to your own research, thinking, or interests. Basically just go through your slip-box as it only contains those things. **Do not** collect, instead develop ideas, arguments, and discussions. // Questions to ask: “Does the new information contradict, correct, support or add to what you already have (in the slip-box or on your mind)? Can you combine ideas to generate something new? What questions are triggered by them?  ” // One idea per note in full sentences with sources and references. Be as precise, clear and brief as possible — you are writing this for someone else to understand.
4. Add your permanent note and link it directly (behind an existing note) or indirectly by connecting it to related notes or linking it to an index (MOC) as an entry point fir a topic or discussion 
5. Develop your topics, questions, and research from the bottom up from within your main [[slip-box]]. Then go read more, fill in your gaps of understanding and strengthen your arguments. Only follow your interests and the path that leads to more insights. Never cling to an idea, keep moving forward.
6. Your topic to write about must always be based on what you have. Copy relevant notes to your “desktop” in order and check for what is missing and what is redundant. Never wait to have everything figured out, just start, and get back to reading and note-taking to fill in the rest to improve arguments, ideas, and their structure.
7. Turn the notes into rough drafts by translating them into the context of your argument. Keep an eye open for holes in the argument, fill them in, or change the argument.
8. Edit and proofread. Then move onto the next work/manuscript.

P.44
- Your standard workday must include
	- Reading and taking notes for 2 hours
	- Building connections in the slip-box
	- Writing papers for my arguments or discussions 
#### Ch.03: Everything You Need to Have
P.45
- “According to this story, the Russians faced the same problem. So they used pencils (De Bono, 1998, 141). The slip-box follows the Russian model: Focus on the essentials, don’t complicate things unnecessarily”
- The slip-box is a workflow that is stripped of all distractions from what is important, the work, the thinking. Our brains are not good at objective storage of information it is for connecting and creating.

P.47-
- The tool box, things you need for the work. Keep in mind the best tools are free.
	- Something to capture like pen and paper, have a central inbox.
	- Reference management system like Notion, keep the notes in alpha order using “AuthorYear”.
	- The [[slip-box]] like Obsidian, emulate the size of a postcard (A6) which is the following measurements digitally: 100-130 words at 5-6mm tall in handwriting, which is about 2-3 tweets (max length of 280 characters) of text at 40-55 words at 5-7 characters per word.
	- An editor like Pages, if you can make use of the same tool for the previous steps do so as long as it stays simple and connects well with the reference management system.

P.48
- “More is unnecessary, less is impossible.”

P.50
- [[Daniel Lüdecke]]
#### Ch.04 A Few Thing to Keep in Mind
P.51
- Always take the time to learn and know how your tools work as they are only as good as you know how to use them. 
- “The slip-box, for example, would most likely be used as an archive for notes – or worse: a graveyard for thoughts (cf. Hollier 2005, 40 on Mallarmé’s index cards”
