Men have an inherent understanding that as men we are meant to sacrifice ourselves for others. Our life is meant to be in constant danger so there’s a natural unconscious desire to be and feel and experience comfort.

Woman have the opposite inherent understanding to men which makes them more risk averse. There is an unconscious understanding of their value and that they must be sheltered and protected from self.

This is why much of today’s men’s content online is about pushing men to take risks — it’s needed for us to become men, but not for women.
