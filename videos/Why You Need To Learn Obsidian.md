## Setting Up
- Create your first vault by making use of iCloud as a means of backing up your data for future-proofing and privacy
- Most people spend way too much time in the plug-ins and themes areas customizing the app, don't fall into this trap
- Understanding the community plugins can have malicious code, however, sticking with the most popular of plug-ins is a good strategy
## Bi-Directional Links
- The Graph View shows the connections of your thoughts visually
- Growing your vault gives you the resources to produce more works
- `CMD + P` opens a local view of the Graph View that you can drag over to the right side panel to view and explore your own connections
## Markdown
- The display of this varies based on the theme that you are using
- `CMD + E` toggles between editor and preview mode
- In preview mode, you do not see any of the markdown-specific characters
