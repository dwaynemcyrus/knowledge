## Summary

## Handouts
### Your Resources
$500 from nothing in 30 days.

A full legitimate business that has monthly revenue.

THAT is what you're building and we assume you have ZERO prior experience.

This would be impossible if it wasn't for the resources we give you.

### The Library
We have every single Tate Interview, Confidential and ANY video of him ever recorded and indexed.

Want to find Tate talking about a Bugatti?

Just use the 📚︱tate-library search function.

We have made finding specific clips as easy as possible

You do not need to spend hundreds of hours looking for clips and indexing them.

We already have.

### The Ammo Box
The Ammo Box is where me, @Ole and all your fellow students can share clips or new interviews in real time.

`🔫︱ammo-box` is where anything NEW will be posted immediately.

Eventually anything posted in `🔫︱ammo-box` makes it's way into [📚︱tate-library](tate-library.md) although it may take a while.

### Bugatti Examples
Bugatti Examples are where great videos are posted.

They're examples and a level of quality YOU should aspire for in your videos.

Every single post from `🏎︱bugatti-examples` is a post YOU could do with very minimal editing skills.

It doesn't take insane editing, it's about making the content clean and easy to digest.

It's the gold standard for how your content quality should look like.

### Ole's Work Diary
This will give you an example of the amount of work that needs to be done to run a business.

`📔︱oles-work-diary` is where your Assistant Professor @Ole writes down his daily worklist for his own social media accounts.

He shares these so you can see THERE IS ALWAYS WORK TO BE DONE.

An important lesson when your goal is to conquer earth and scale your business to world class levels of income. 

### Golden Laws of Affiliating
One final note.

I want every single one of you to read `🥇︱golden-laws-of-affiliation` 
Any breach in any of those 3 laws will result in immediate termination from this server and the course.

It will also delete any affiliate balance we owe you.

We will go into the details of the products you're allowed to sell, how exactly payout and the tracking works, on Day 21.

Remember the gameplan, 

The first 21 days are focused on growth.

You monetise later, we will explain the entire process when the time comes.
