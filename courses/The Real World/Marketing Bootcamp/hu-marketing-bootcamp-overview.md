## Summary

## Notes
### Introduction
Many of you will realise,

You cannot be lazy in here.

Every day is a task that won't be easy, you can't just coast.

Making $500 in 30 days entirely online isn't easy, if it was everyone would do it.

This will require working every single second you have spare, everyday the next 30 days.

No video games, no jerking off, no parties, no movies, YOU DO NOT HAVE TIME.

This is bootcamp.

If you're actually serious about starting your business, this is what it takes.

The MINIMUM to pass is $500 in 30 days.

My goal is for one of you to hit $5k.

I have a very set plan that will work.

But you need to work, you need to ask questions and you need to trust the process.
