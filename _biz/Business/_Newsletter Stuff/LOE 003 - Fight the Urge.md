Battling your mind is nothing short of exhausting...

Fighting the urge to get back into the prison of my mind has been an uphill battle.

Stepping out into what's possible is scary.

There is nothing comfortable about rejecting negative beliefs. Letting go of the "responsibility" of others' emotional baggage is the only way to begin moving.

Yet, here we are. Taking the steps, moving towards living life by our own design.

*The Beautiful Unknown.*

We must believe that there is a better life for us. That when we move in the direction of our fears answers will reveal themselves.

This is why it is so imperative for us to **FIGHT THE URGE!**

I found myself sitting in analysis paralysis many times this past week. Wasting the one resource that neither of us can get back...time. And that's okay. As long as you recognize the negative behaviour and fight to do what you know is better for you.

The more we fight against the behaviours that limit us the stronger we become. further away we move from the prison of our minds.

As your tribe leader, I demand that you **DO NOT** return to that prison.

There is nothing there for you anymore.

Nothing, but misery.

Sincerely,
*Dwayne Cyrus*
