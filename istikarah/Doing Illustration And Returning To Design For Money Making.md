101:11 — Immediately, we are coming with pure energy and I have no clue whether this will be good or bad for me, Allah SWT know best. Tell me Ya Rabb! 
Surah — So a great warning of being a good or bad person in preparation for the [[Day Of Judgement]].

First
2:29 — The creating that Allah SWT has performed is beautiful, the entire universe. However, Allah SWT how does this align with what I am asking? 
2:25-34 — Allah SWT is speaking to me more about my state to hold tight and let go of what I am to do as a Muslim. Be a Muslim, a RIGHTEOUS Muslim, this is your way.  Allah SWT what does this have to do with going back to the arts? Please guide me.

Second
18:47 — The day of judgement, but more so the collecting of souls, a return home. 
18:40-53 — Allah SWT you are reminding me of the arrogance of [[Iblis]] to think I know better when commanded. Is this it? 

Third 
29:43 — Okay, so I need to think…what would be the logic in what Allah SWT is telling me? Submission…I have been fighting against this natural state of mine being the arts. And this is what Allah SWT has put inside of me no matter how much I run. 
29:39-47 — Stop denying the work…the truth of what Allah SWT is providing to you. Trust in Allah SWT this is what you are being told commit! The arts are your pathway, now make it work for you! 

Close
28:41 — I’m going to assume before I move forward is that we are speaking of deniers disbelievers.
28:38-43 — So here we are again being pushed and reminded of the defiance of Paroah and the submission of Musa and that the Book was revealed to them. So too, have your skills and direction has been revealed to you! 

Conclusion 
Get back to it!
