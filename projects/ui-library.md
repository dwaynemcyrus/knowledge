## Vision
To demonstrate **systems thinking through design translation** — bridging visual design and functional engineering.

## Core Features
- Tokenized color, type, and spacing system.  
- Modular React component library (buttons, modals, forms, nav).  
- Dynamic documentation site generated from Astro content.  
- Interactive sandbox for component testing.

## Technical Highlights
- Built with **Astro** using **React Islands**.  
- **Tailwind CSS** driven by design-token JSON.  
- Figma → Code synchronization workflow via exported variables.  
- Storybook-style previews integrated directly into the portfolio.
