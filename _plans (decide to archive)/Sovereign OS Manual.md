## Design
Design (define) in other words we are defining who we want to become, and the ship that will take me there. Let's get ourself in order, who are we and what it is we ware achieving and aiming to accomplish leaving after we die.

This is about clarity of who you are and your desires and way of being.
### Origin
We make use of the rewriting work from [[Souen Ursule-Cyrus]] and [[Jordan Peterson]]’s program the [[Self Authoring Suite]] with modifications. It is an additional fee unless we can get it bundled in with this program through some sort of partnership. The rewriting will obviously require more work to flush out, how to teach this to others. You will need to make his work your own and incorporate it into the system instead of an extra charge.

### Reason
We make use of the book [[Ikigai]] along with the methodology from [[Chris Do]]‘s YouTube videos mixed with Voyager’s customized process document to define your purpose and reason for being.
#### Phase 01
Fill out each document with a full exploration of yourself, nothing is off the table just be honest with yourself and go at it in the following order: Love Doing, Good At, World Needs, then Paid.

**Steps:**
- Brain dump into all of the areas that fit each category based on their prompts.
- Refine and organize your lists by giving them numbers, and these numbers are not based on any order or hierarchy, it’s for ranking maybe 

**Work Files:**

- [[SOS 1445-1446 Reason#World Needs|World Needs]]
- [[SOS 1445-1446 Reason#Paid For|Paid For]]
#### Phase 02
Seek out complimentary connections between each category list. You are looking at the overlaps in reference to the diagram example.

**Steps:**
1. Making complimentary connections (links/themes) between the categories of "good at" "world needs", etc. You want to find what combinations work well together, as many as possible. Starting with what the world, paid, good ,and then love. This part is best done on paper and or with digital stickies, white boarding ya know! Use this area to document the themes you came up with...go for quantity over quality, have fun.
2. Remove any connection that do not give you an opportunity to be paid in a relatively obvious way.
3. For each list you want to pull out the top 9-12 items that rank the highest for you.

**Work Files:**

### Legacy
Here you will get clarity on the legacy you want to leave after you die. Some of the information needed below may actually come out of the Authoring work, so keep that in mind.

**Legacy means:** a gift by will especially of money or other personal property / something transmitted by or received from an ancestor or predecessor or from the past / is passed from one generation to the next and often refers to gifts of money or property
#### Phase 01
Let's get to the core of who you are to accomplish finding the legacy you will leave behind after your passing.

**Steps:**
1. Answer each question to reflect the core of your story
2. Get clear on the categories of people who can benefit from your lived experiences thus far.
3. Lastly, you will describe your One Person, this is who you need to impact most, basically think about the past you, the child you, and where your legacy will primarily be built on.

#### Phase 02
We need to gain an understanding for what would be most valuable to these groupings of people we are going to be serving to build our legacy upon. We will be making use of the [[Value Proposition Design by ...]] process.

### Identity
Inner is focused on what in my heart and soul just for me... what makes me at my core.

Let's work the core system to develop one's identity (personal brand) stuff ya know... This work is meant to continue off of the legacy work yea? Or this just the manifesto? What's the end result? Keep in mind this area is still building off of the Legacy work, which may need to be number 3 in the order of things.

Bonus work at the end is to write your story! Like how Charles has asked you to do. Maybe this exercise starts with key highlights in chronological order. Then you go off and write the story.
#### Phase 01
You need to identify with others so that you are not walking blindly when you do not have to. Men who have walked similar paths before you to guide you along in your development.
