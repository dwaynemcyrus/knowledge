## Vision
**Scriptorium** is a privacy-first writing environment built for the Apple ecosystem.  
It brings together the focused clarity of iA Writer, the aesthetic richness of Bear, and the interconnected intelligence of Obsidian.  
It’s designed for creators, strategists, and thinkers who want to write, link, and recall ideas seamlessly.

## Core Features
- **Minimal Markdown Editor:** Clean, distraction-free interface with syntax highlighting and live preview.  
- **Note Linking:** Wiki-style `[[links]]` create a network of ideas.  
- **AI Writing Assistant:** Suggests improvements, summaries, or connections across notes.  
- **Library View:** Organize by tags, projects, or recency with smooth Apple-style animations.  
- **Local-First Architecture:** All data stored offline with optional iCloud backup.

## Technical Highlights
- Markdown/MDX-based data model (Astro content collections).  
- AI context functions via **OpenAI API** or **local embeddings (MLX)**.  
- Built using **React Components** within Astro Islands for hybrid rendering.  
- IndexedDB or SQLite for offline persistence.  
- Planned transition to **SwiftUI** once core UX is perfected.

## Portfolio Purpose
Scriptorium demonstrates:
- UI minimalism and typographic craft  
- Markdown and data-model design  
- Knowledge graph logic and semantic search  
- Applied AI for creative enhancement
