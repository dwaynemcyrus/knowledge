A brotherhood of men around me who align with my values and morals alongside my Tatsu who I lead and speak with daily in our pursuit of conquering this Dunya. 
## Istikarah
95:5 — Do not follow or lead men towards anything that is not righteous 
37:66 — Not being righteous will lead you to wrong doing and pain, nothing good will come of consuming what is bad 
12:19 — Freedom from your current state of isolation will come with a cost and know that Allah is watching and knows. Other will take you in.
19:57 — Be known as a man of truth just like the [[Prophet Idris]]
