Istikarah 

Makin Hijrah to New York and buying my ticket this week.

  

Open: 103:2 ??? Allah I do feel lost coming back here. // Whole surah- I will not be lost if I believe 

  

1st : 75:10 This is exactly what I am asking…where is the escape… // 106-14 Look at what was sent before and follow it before the end. Could this be to look at my previous Istikarah and take that as my direction.

  

2nd: 15:96 A warning for me in the actions of holding my fear above where and what Allah has put in my mind and heart and way // 94-99 Submit making the move and act in accordance to Allah and his word. 

  

3rd : 96:11 I guess this is to give me some certainty yea… // Surah Let go of your arrogance and remember Allah is why you have anything move for the sake of Allah do not stay because you worship fear

  

Close 45:7 Don’t make yourself a liar by not doing what you say. // 1-12 How many times will Allah till you the Qur’an is guidance and you know this. ACT! Do not be a hypocrite or one for the fires out of arrogance.
