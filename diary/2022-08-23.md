### Ask
Question: How do I become the example, the warrior of Islam (a sword of Allah) for my Ummah?

Open: 63:10 Give to the Ummah do not hold back, your wealth is not just money, but your knowledge, your gift, your vision, you insight, your message, give it all to the Ummah everything that Allah has provided you! 

First — 94:2 Give it all and Allah will remove the burden you have right now of providing for your family. Do I have this right Allah? Am I to become this speaker this leader? Now from this small room? (This Surah needs to be in your daily.)

Second — 83:34 This you confirming my questions aren’t you, of course you are this how I live with you Allah. Subhan’Allah!! You are serious with me about being a leader. I remember walking and speaking as young teen with the confidence and knowledge that I would lead people. But here I am in position to do so with everything in line for me to do the work. I am scared, you have given me vision and strategy, and signs yesterday! 

Third — 22:29 Allah, what does this mean? Where am I going? Who am I allowing. To make the rounds, to revolve my life around the ways of the prophet to embody all that made him who he was. The characteristic! Allah I love talking to you!
