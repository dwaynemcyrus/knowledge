## Summary
A clear and well put together step-by-step process of implementing and making use of the Zettelkasten system into an actual piece of produced content.
  
## Highlights
- Be sure to set create new notes under the current folder your are in, you will need to decide if this is good for YOUR system
- Adding an exclamation mark in front of linked items allows you to view the content in the reading view
- You are meant to use your permanent notes as your primary source for your projects like a blog post 

### Overview Setup
1. Make 3 folders fleeting, permanent literature 
2. In the template create a “map of content”, which is a numbered list of your various topics for a given theme
3. In the template folder create a “note template”, add meta data to auto-fill for date created and a header for “References” with a numbered list which is for links, internal and external

### Working with the Documents
1. Part of the process for implementing is to document your highlights from the source
2. Write up the literature notes in your own words
3. Create a a new permanent link like “bootstrapping a startup” using the map of content, this will be an entry point
4. The first numbered list within that note is “what is bootstrapping?”
5. Fill out the new permanent note using your literature notes to answer the question “what is bootstrapping?”
6. Be sure to link your notes under the References area of these new notes, to maintain trace ability 

## Producing Content
1. Make a folder called projects (like an article)
2. Outline the areas of your article
3. Link your existing permanent notes under each section
4. Fill out the remaining areas as you go with more research
