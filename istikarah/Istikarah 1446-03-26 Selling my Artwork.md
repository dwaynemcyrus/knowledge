  - Selling my Artwork

## The Ask
You told me before about my artwork being a source of much wealth for me. I don’t need to be rich and all that stuff, but I do require the financial resources in order to take care of others. You know to be a medium of wealth generation and transfer to fellow creations.

So I ask again Ya Rabb is Art a pathway towards my wealth along with my coaching. I want to pursue art as a career path. Tell me is my provision still in alignment with the visual arts.
## The Response

First: 

91:5 So here’s a declaration another one today. I am listening Ya Rabb. 

  

91:Surah In this work is opportunity for righteousness and in doing this work is for you to be of Allah SWT. Allah SWT made you perfectly, so follow and obey! 

  

Please give me some more clarity Ya Rabb. Is this part of my work to be a righteous man and in turn you will provide for my family and the community?

  

Second: Man

76:4 I have not been believing in what you have given to me to do, I certainly feel shackled and chained. I experienced freedom when I was doing your work. Creating art and serving the people. 

  

76:1-7 

You forget who created you. You are a creation. You are a man of God. Because of your lack in belief you cause your own suffering in this world. To be closer to Allah SWT is to keep your word. Always.

  

Third: Luqman 

31:7 This is how serious Allah SWT is about you! Straight call out. You have been carrying yourself and behaving as though Allah SWT has not made what you need to do crystal clear. 

  

31:4 This is the word of Allah SWT and Allah SWT speaks to you through this book. Your work is a serious matter to Allah SWT. You must speak the words of Allah SWT through your work, it is from Allah SWT. You have been blessed like Luqman and do not operate in gratitude.
## The Reflection
I do suffer not making art 😓😢😭. This has gotten far deeper than just provision. Geez… you have been granted religious wisdom and understanding and you horde it. You must be spreading this knowledge for the benefit of others. You have been blessed like Luqman and it is time I be grateful and watch for the signs of Allah SWT.

This is a serious matter.
