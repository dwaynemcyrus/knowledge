The Ask

Coaching Work, Ya Rabb do I try and sell my coaching? Is this how a tart making money this very weekend in order to provide for myself and my family as a Muslim man is supposed to do? 

  

Please guide me, tell. Or do I make art like you told me to do last time that that’s where my riches are? 

  

Let’s start with just the coaching and consulting, tell me please! 

  

The Response

First: The Fig

95:2 Ya Allah SWT I have no ideo what this is suppose to mean. I know I need to study more instead of watching shows like The Walking Dead.

  

95:Surah The fig which relates to my symbol the Banyan tree which is a fig tree, and the mount where God spoke to Moses (my prophet again). Really need to study his life! And Mecca where the Prophet started his mission. You have been made beautifully and that you must engage in righteousness. 

  

So why are you still in doubt of Gods plans and guidance. Damn.

  

Second: The Cave

18:28 Fix your focus. Stop following your woman and kids in the way that you do. Reconnect yourself with those who make Salat and seek Allah SWT in the morning and evening. Is the first first my answer though? To my work? To I need to do this weekend? 

  

18:25-31

The people of the cave? 300 years, the number 3? My 3 month stints… and another reminder of do good deed and Jannah will be here for you. I read that and thought of my lives and how I helped people. Publish that work, and get back to it, with Khalv’s plan added alongside Nadeem.

  

Ya Allah SWT I still require more clarity please. I need to earn money this weekend for rent and for a flight out and to cover a room in Malaysia, Turkey, or Canada. Even the States. 

  

Please. Though I think it is clear I fear it. I know it is clear. 

  

Third: The Sun

91:5 So God is going to make clear something here…I’m excited, please set me straight!!! 

  

91:Surah The Creator. Remember this.

  

Never forget Al-Khaliq. And you have.

  

Hey back to your practice of Islam and purify your soul. You were warned about your wife and kids being a test to you. You didn’t understand how, but now you do! 

  

The Reflection

Your work has been to worship Allah SWT since you came, no remembered your Islam. Remember the greatest honour of your life. You stood for what was right, righteousness. You model goodness and proper character. 

  

You were the example! Then hardship came and you hid, went dark, no longer allowed your light to shine bright. You let the devil beat you.

  

Fuck.

  

You know this. The only way forward is to return to your work, and your work came from Allah SWT. The only difference now is that you will be of more service and not close the doors to receiving your provision, which you did before.

  

That was sabotage. You will no longer think of yourself as not worthy. Forget that nonsense. Be like the Prophets, be misunderstood, have people villainize you (again). Stand for righteousness.

  

This is your only way, Allah SWT has made this abundantly clear.
