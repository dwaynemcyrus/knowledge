This is where we need to look at where you want to be at in 10 - 50 per-say, as in what is the vision of this. Or these are your big picture visions that you are pushing to achieve in the next 5-10 years =D. When filling out the visions we...want to keep it to a maximum of 1-3 items, preferably in this order starting from the current year 2, 3, 4 or to encourage clarity and focus.
## Phase 01
Work with the Areas of Life.
### Steps
1. Define all of the areas or pillars of your life to keep your attention on and rate each one in the front matter.
2. For each pillar you want to define how it will serve as an act of worship to Allah for the sake of your [[Akhirah]] in a sentence or two.
3. Based on the areas of your life you will describe in detail what they will look like in 10 years, your vision along with the intention of how this area will be an act of worship
4. Fill out the outcome you want to create this year, make sure each is written in the present as though you already have in along with an “I am” statement of belief.
5.  Go over each area and make Istikarah to check what Allah SWT has to say about this.
6. Akhirah is your intention as a Muslim which should be to worship Allah SWT
7. Set your Destination which will be a single target for your vision which you will use for your horizons
8. Map the major milestones you will need to achieve in order to reach your vision, these will be known as your horizons. Do this from a 10 year outlook.
