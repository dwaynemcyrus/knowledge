## Anti-Vision
What you do not want in your life…
- To be under the schedule of anyone, no one controls me, what I do where I go, how I do anything, what I say and don’t say, I DECIDE
- To worry and be stuck in a job or any relationship that has me feeling trapped I have done far too much of this
- To be a shadow artist, a person stuck wishing and hoping to create and build and express while watching others do what I crave most
- To disappear, to hide from life and people and opportunities and success I have always found my way out and then go back into hiding
- To live like the rest, cheap dopamine, no morals, just slaves to emotion and desire I been that and it disgusts me, I am better than that much better
- To pretend to be anything I am not for the sake of money, status, or any relationship with anyone, hiding myself and wearing a mask I am done with that life it’s exhausting 
- To look in the mirror and see a boy, in my grooming and in my physique, in my eyes I know that I am weak in this state and it’s pathetic truly pathetic
- For my name to be lost in history, that I lived and died and no one talks of me 100 years later, no one studies me, no one references my life to learn to live, to be forgotten
- To watch and feel my body waste away, never becoming never experiencing the power of a man I have always been small and I don’t want that I hate it physically, mentally, socially I live small
- To live small and not experience the greatness of my name my experiences, this world and all the beauty it has to offer small is pathetic and sad I will not live like the rest
- To live in survival unable to buy what I want do what I want take care of who I want to be dependent on anyone and thing other than God, being at the mercy of others is the life of a begger not a giver I give I create from nothing like Allah SWT 
- To be alone, no network, no people riding and dying for me, being of the 99%, a loser, a normal person, it’s sick when I am fucking amazing I just don’t show it
- To be out of alignment with Allah SWT, God has and continues to give me so much and in the face of that I spit on Gods mercy on me by living small and hiding and being fearful of anyone and thing other than him 
- For my family beyond my wife and kids to be fragmented and or suffering from money problems, to suffer because of a thing that is not real is a sickness it’s disgusting work from evil people and I will not allow my tribe to be subject to that
- The best of foods and health is foreign to me, out of my rich, something that is out of my grasp why when it’s supposed to be accessible to me at anytime it’s accessible to others why am I on the outside

- Being at the mercy of another for anything, that makes me a slave, that make me weak, that makes me vulnerable to them, it puts me out of control of my life and I want to cry in anger just thinking of that
- Being afraid to act to risk for the sake of my own desires wants needs self-interest development and simple joys, fear has had me stuck in a cycle of unworthiness for far too long fucking long
- Not having a voice for my life, being and feeling silenced, hiding my thoughts and opinions and desires like a scared bitch of a man why so others can be comfortable fuck that at the cost of your voice

- Being disconnected from those I love because of my own false ideas of shame and guilt it’s stupid you are Cyrus, live up to the fucking name The Benevolent Dictator!

- Hair that is not locked long and unhealthy un groomed beard looking like I have no owner as though I am not royalty as though I am not to be respected
- Not travelling regularly always at home like some loser not out in the world making owning creating meeting and leading the people

## Sea to Cross
*"By 28 February 2025 (29 Shbn. 1446) I will have in my possession 240'000 CHF in monthly reoccuring profits at 96% margins after a maximum of 24% tax cut, which will come to me in increasing amounts during the interim. In return for the money I will give the most sufficient possible quality of service in the capacity of group and 1-1 remote education on trauma recovery. I believe that I will have this money in my possession. My faith is so strong that I can now see this money before my eyes. I can touch it with my hands. It is now awaiting transfer to me at the time and in the proportion that I deliver the service I intend to render in return for it. I am awaiting a plan by which to accumulate this money and I will follow that plan when it is received."*

### Remove Distractions
*"Success is less about discipline and more about focus."* — [[Dan Koe]]

List all of the potential distractions between you and the goal aka *sea to cross*.
- Wife
- Kids
- Overthinking
- Needing to research more to stall
- Organizing my works to stall
- Watching shows to stay up later
- Needing a good design for my website 
- Writing and rewriting online bios
- Checking social media to envy people doing what I want

**Disappear from all of your distractions.**

Start from zero everything your did doesn’t matter tomorrow when you wake up you are fresh and you will focus on creating, learning, building, connecting, and experiencing as much as possible every single day while filtering everything through your anti-vision and sea to cross.
