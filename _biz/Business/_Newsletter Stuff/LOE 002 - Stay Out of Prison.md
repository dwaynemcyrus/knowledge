It's mind over matter.
And you need to win.

Your prison is NOT your home. 
Your environment does not control you.

You have survived. You are alive.
You are on a voyage to greatness, to happiness, to peaceful discomfort. 

**All by your own design.**

Do not allow your environment to dictate who you are.

Sincerely,  
*Dwayne Cyrus*
