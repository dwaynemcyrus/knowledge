This is a project about building men.

emotional challenges as the true core work of becoming a righteous sovereign man who leads his family and builds community. 

Unlike other project about building men, only Dwayne Cyrus focuses on the ignored emotional, spiritual, and mental work (in becoming righteous men) oto heal and recover traumatized men towards lives of  sovereign living with family and community at its core. 

Make traumatized survivors to build emotional development and live lives of sovereignty as w holistically developed men. Moving them from emotional slavery to emotional mastery.

I am focusing of men of color in particular, black men specifically. The men who desire to live roles of leadership in their families and community. I especially would like to work with men who have gone through emotional and/or sexual abuse like myself so that I can teach and guide them through from healing to recovery to growth
