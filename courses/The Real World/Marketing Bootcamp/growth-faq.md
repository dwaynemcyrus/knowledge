## No.01 Is my location important? 
No. When you first create your account, people from your home country will likely be the first ones TikTok shows your videos to. 

For guys from non-english speaking countries and/or poor countries this can seem like an issue. 

But the TikTok algo isn't stupid, nor your enemy. 

The TikTok algo is your best friend, and probably the most advanced algo ever. 

It is literally programmed and designed to show your videos to the best possible audience. 

Therefore, at first it can be that your audience is just your home country, and when you in combination with that are also getting low views, then it can seem like your location is reponsible for the low views. 

But it's not, the only problem you can have with living in a non-english speaking and/or poor country is that you'll have a harder start because those are the people it will show it to first. 

But TikTok will notice that your content is better for english guys and it will start to show your videos to the right guys accordingly. 

It will realise: 
- The guys from his country that watch english videos engage better than the ones who only watch native videos 
- Let's see how english speaking guys from countries near him engage 
- Ah, they all like it, let's see how his content is received by UK & US guys 
- Ah, they love it even more 
- We'll show it to US, UK and some other english speaking guys 

If your content is actually interesting and good, you'll break through the 'country barrier'. 

Posting good content continuously will make you get US, UK guys etc. as an audience. 

I've seen it plenty of times already and just by helping guys to improve their content, managed to help guys from Pakistan, Norway, and from all over the world to get millions of views from english countries. 

So, no, your location isn't an excuse for low views.

## No.02 Is it okay to use VPN's? 
Wouldn't recommend. 

TikTok knows you are using a VPN, and depending on who else is using the same VPN, this can cause trouble. 

If some Russian hackers are using the same VPN to spam TikTok with fake accounts, they will just blacklist you with them. 

Not saying VPN's will get you banned immediately, in most cases nothing will happen. 

But it's not net positive, and if it's not net positive, I'd just avoid it if you can.

## No.03 I **think I'm shadowbanned, how do I deal with it?** 
I don't believe you. 

What most people call shadowbans is just an excuse for not making high quality content. 

And fake gurus on YouTube trying to use the topic to make views and sell courses. 

I guarantee you, 99% of you who think you're shadowbanned, you're not shadowbanned. 

The 1% that actually is shadowbanned has 0 views for over a week and literally can't be found via search. 

Even if you get just 10 views - that's not a shadow ban because you're still getting views. 

I also want you to look at it through the eyes of TikTok, why would they 'shadowban' you if they could just ban you for real? 

If you're experiencing low views, there's only one answer and that is to make better content. 

TikTok stops promoting your videos? 

It didn't liked how people engaged with it. 

Time to improve it. 

After Day 21 of the tutorials, you should all know exactly how to get there, and if not, re-read the lessons, utilise the ask-luc, ask-ole and ask-students channel and ask for help if something's not clear

## No.04 TikTok banned me, how do I deal with the ban?
At some point it can happen that your account gets banned. 

And when that happens, you're in one of 2 scenarios: 
- You actually broke TOS and the ban is deserved. 
- You didn't broke TOS and the ban is undeserved. 

You will be in one of the 2 scenarios, if you don't know if you broke TOS, read them here: [https://www.tiktok.com/legal/terms-of-service](https://www.tiktok.com/legal/terms-of-service "https://www.tiktok.com/legal/terms-of-service") 

And if you're not sure if one of your videos was on the edge, just assume it was. 

So, as you now know in which scenario you are, here's how to solve them. 

### When you actually broke TOS 
You come from a position of weakness and guilt. You regret making the mistakes, totally understand the ban, will never do it again and only want to bring positivity for the platform. You‘d very appreciate a second chance. 

You're humble, friendly and understanding of mistake. 

### Why you didn't broke TOS 
You also come from a position of weakness but you‘re 100% confident that you were doing the right thing. You know the TOS, you read them, you only aim to bring positivity to the platform and you always carefully assess that your videos are fine. You‘d very appreciate if someone could take another look at it. 

You're humble, friendly and don't accuse them of making a mistake.

***

Those are the frames you need to have in your appeal. 

And you will write your appeal with that in mind and you'll send it to TikTok every single day, over and over again. 

Now, some of you will sit and say: 

"*But Ole, I don't have an appeal button."* 
*"But Ole, I only can appeal once."* 

For that we got the secret appeal form: [https://www.tiktok.com/legal/report/feedback](https://www.tiktok.com/legal/report/feedback "https://www.tiktok.com/legal/report/feedback") Stay safe.

## No.05 A video got banned, what should I do?
Appeal it. 

Doesn't matter if it broke TOS or not, just appeal the ban and try to get it back online. 

It will happen that videos are taken down that didn't broke any TOS, that's just people mass reporting your video and there's nothing to worry about. 

TikTok will accept the appeal and put the videos back online in those cases.

## No.06 How do I deal with insults or slurs in my videos? Should I censor them?
If Tate is saying things like: _"Shit", "Fuck", "Hot bitch"_ 

Then you shouldn't worry too much about it and you can just leave it there. You can make it "sh*t" or "f*ck" if you want, but TikTok doesn't really care. 

What they care about are insults or threats. That's a no go. 

Tate saying he's gonna smash up Logan Paul's face? Cut it out completely. 

Censoring things like "fuck" or "shit" isn't necessary. 

TikTok might see it and say: _"Okay, this guy isn't kid friendly, we will show his videos to more mature guys"_ 

But kids aren't your target audience anyway, so that's nothing to be concerned about and you'll end up on a more 'mature' fyp anyway. 

So, normal words that aren't insults, you can just keep. 

But insults or threats, cut them out completely, because when someone reports your video, it's already enough when people can hear/imagine the insult.

## No.07 Does posting times matter?
No, the best time to post is right after you finished the video. 

However, if you notice that your videos tend to perform better if you post them at 7 PM, then post them at 7 PM. 

But there's no evidence that suggests that posting times has an influence on the amount of views a video gets.

## No.08 Where do I find music? 
Finding good music comes down to going down rabbitholes. 

You either do that on TikTok through popular sounds and profiles that use good sounds. (Like this one - [https://www.tiktok.com/@wifistack/](https://www.tiktok.com/@wifistack/ "https://www.tiktok.com/@wifistack/")) 

Or on YouTube by finding good music, saving it to playlists and making the algorithm recommend you similar music. (Like 'Zack Hemsey' and 'Really Slow Motion' for motivational music) 

Now, you may wonder how you add the cool music you found to your videos. 

Either you download the song from YouTube as an .mp3 and just add it to your video. 

Or you search for the sound on TikTok and add via the 'add sound' function in the App itself.

## No.09 How many videos can I post per day?
Keep it at a maximum of 6. 

And space each upload out with minimum 1-2 hours.

## No.10 I have 0 views on my video what should I do?
Totally normal for new accounts, might take a day or two for TikTok to start showing your videos. 

Nothing to worry about.

## No.11 Can I also post content from other figures? 
Of course, this is the end goal. 

But understand that to make an interesting clip of Person X, it will take 10x the amount of time and effort than to make an interesting Tate clip. 

THAT is why we focus on the cheatcode.

## No.12 How many hours should I put into this? 
All your spare time. 

All you can do is work as hard as possible.

## No.13 My videos got reported for branded content, what should I do? 
If it‘s from a creator that has nothing to do with Tate, then just click the button that says:

*Yes, it‘s branded content.* 

If not, click the button that says it’s not branded content.
