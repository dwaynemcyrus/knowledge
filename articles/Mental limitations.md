Mental limitations refer to constraints on a person’s cognitive, emotional, or psychological functioning that impact their ability to think, reason, process information, or manage emotions effectively. These limitations can arise from various factors, including trauma, mental health disorders, stress, or negative thought patterns. Examples of mental limitations include:

	1.	Cognitive Distortions: Irrational or biased ways of thinking that can perpetuate negative emotions and behaviors.
	2.	Emotional Dysregulation: Difficulty in managing and responding to emotional experiences in a healthy way.
	3.	Negative Self-Beliefs: Persistent negative thoughts about oneself, often stemming from past trauma or criticism.
	4.	Memory and Concentration Issues: Problems with retaining information or maintaining focus, which can be common in individuals with PTSD or anxiety.
	5.	Fear and Anxiety: Overwhelming feelings of fear or anxiety that can prevent taking action or making decisions.
	6.	Learned Helplessness: A condition where a person feels unable to change their situation due to repeated past failures or traumas.
	7.	Low Self-Esteem: A lack of confidence in one’s worth or abilities, often resulting from negative experiences or self-perceptions.
