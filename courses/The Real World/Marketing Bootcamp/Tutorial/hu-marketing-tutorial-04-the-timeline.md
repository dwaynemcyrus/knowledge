## Summary

## Handouts
### The Timeline
$500 in 30 days means you need to be on track.

No one got rich on accident,

You won't reach $500 in 30 days on accident.

The first 21 days you will be focusing ENTIRELY on hitting 10k followers.

You will struggle the most in the first 10 days.

The timeline is as follows.
- Days 1-10 = Hit 1,000 followers
- Days 10-14 = Hit 5,000 followers.
- Days 14-21 = Hit 10,000 followers.

Once you hit 10,000 followers you will immediately begin monetisation mode.

You'll have 10 days to monetise $500.

That will be on average 50 sales, or 5 sales a day.

In other words, you only need 5 of your 10,000 followers to buy from you per day for 10 days.

If you miss a milestone, it doesn't mean you're doomed.

I want you guys to understand that this timeline can only be kept with extreme work ethic.

This is the easiest business model in the world,

That does not mean it's EASY.

You are learning exactly how business is done and creating a successful profitable business in 30 days.

If it was easy, everyone would do it.

If you TRY success is guaranteed.

The issue most of you will face, is you've never actually TRIED anything your entire life.

We will have resources to show you the work ethic required and teach you how to get it. 

### Daily Lessons
Every single day, me and @Ole will be teaching you a new lesson.

These daily lessons are designed to be the main focus of your work that specific day.

We have ordered them to be the best order for you to work on them.

You must learn to crawl before you can walk,

You must walk before you can run.

You are advised to re-read and re-check every past lesson every single day before continuing to the new one.

Re-reading a lesson means you ACTUALLY read it AND check if you're applying it.

Every time you read a lesson, you need to check if you are ACTIVELY using it.
