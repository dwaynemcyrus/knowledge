Vision (of service/impact): My letters maintain a highly engaged audience who take the time to write me back! These letters are cherished by my community and is where I make offers for everything and anything I do to serve the people, my *Voyagers*.

Premise: I help survivors move forward. Unlike other newsletters, I give a voice to the unspoken and a way forward for survivors using my personal experiences, unfiltered and compassionate. 

SPOV: Survivors need to be challenged and pushed forward instead of sitting in spaces stagnant, building trauma-bonds for temporary relief.

Positioning: Letters of Endurance exists to move survivors from emotional slavery to emotional mastery. 

One-line Description: Direction for those seeking a life of freedom after trauma.
