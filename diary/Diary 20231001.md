I had a dream about something I feel it.

Work up in my body with sore muscles in hands and shoulders and chest like I worked out.

Drank morning water.

Thanked Allah for waking me and recited Quran.

No [[Suhoor]], didn’t wake up early enough.

Brushed teeth, washed face, made [[wudu]].

Mirror affirmation, done.

Make bed, done.

Pray Fajr is done.

Fajr dhikr is done.

Fajr shahada is done.
