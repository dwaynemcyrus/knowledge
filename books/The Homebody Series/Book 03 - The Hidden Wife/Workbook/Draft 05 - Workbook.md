## Using the Workbook
It’s important that you understand to get the most out of these exercises, it is a requirement that you are honest with yourself. No one else is meant to complete this work other than you. Nor should anyone else be reading your responses. This is a space for you to be honest with yourself, free from the judgement of others.

There is no shame allowed in this work. What you want, and your experiences are valid on their own without explanation or validation.

Moving forward you will want to have a pen and paper with you as the majority of these exercises will be best experienced written by hand. If you are digital-first kinda gal, that’s not a problem, you will still receive the full and expected results from doing the work.

Most importantly, take your time and DO NOT hesitate to reach out. My contact details can be found at the end of the book.

What’s going to have you stand out is your character, it’s all about how you present yourself. Remember, this is a man who other women are after, so get competitive. I know it goes against the “sisterhood”, but we must be honest. The “sisterhood” does not have getting you traditional minded women married at the top of their priority list.

2. For each person on the list consider how they can best serve you in your search. 
3. For each person you now need to categorize them as the following: 
	- The Listener: Are they best at listening and giving you a space to vent your frustrations or share your excitement? 
	- The Connector: Are they strong in making connections and taking a stand for you?
	- The Grounder: Are they consistent in telling you the harsh truth, even when they know you will be angry at them?
4. Make sure you have one person in each of the previous categories mentioned. Reach out the one person of each list you feel most comfortable with and present to them your pitch as a greater conversation about your search for a husband. 

This is now your Marriage Crew, learn to depend on them moving forward. It would be in your best interest if they were happily married or have positive outlooks towards marriage that align with you. 

No negativity, you can help those women after you have helped yourself.

5. Identity the next upcoming event that you can attend with this woman or women and commit yourself to going.

## Chapter 6: Keeping the Momentum
### Visualize
You will need to refer back to your vision board in our first exercise. It should already be your phone wallpaper. 

Describe in writing how you would feel after having a conversation with your desired future husband about marriage. Everything went well, the areas that you didn’t align on were sorted out with care, consideration, and understanding. Capture that feeling in words as if you are on a walk home or laying on your bed remembering the conversation.

### Self-Care Activities
