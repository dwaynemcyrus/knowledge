- The term “dating” is only used to for ease of understanding, I do not promote or encourage dating for men or women
- The book has been written for all women regardless of religion, ethnicity, culture, and social status. 
- This book is for women desiring to become traditional wives who work hard and value family first.

## Chapter 1: Let Us Begin
This book is specifically designed for traditional women who desire to be noticed by responsible traditional men, but struggle with putting themselves out there. We will expand on the purpose of the book and who it is for, provide an overview of the chapters to come, and explain how the book will benefit you.

The purpose of this book is to help homebodies overcome their fears and insecurities to gain the confidence to present themselves to the world with the right intent. This book has been written for women who value traditional gender roles and want to find a husband who shares those values. It is also for women who may feel overwhelmed or discouraged by the current state of “dating”, but still hold onto the belief that they can find love and build a happy home.

Over the following chapters, I will provide practical advice, strategies, and activities to help you overcome your fears and insecurities, and gain the confidence to put yourself forward. I will cover topics such as defining the person you want to attract, building self-confidence, overcoming fears, taking chances, and more.

This book will benefit you as the guide towards gaining the confidence to put yourself out there, teaching you how to be found by men you desire, and increasing the quality of men you enter into courtship with. It will help you understand what it takes to be found by the right person who shares your values and interests and give you the tools needed to get yourself closer to being the wife of a man you admire and respect.

Keep in mind this will be an experience. One that will be shared between you and I. Don’t give up, push through the feels, and know that I’m a message away should the book get a little too much.

Let's dive in and get started on this exciting journey towards being found!

## Chapter 2: Embracing Marriage
Far too often women who seek marriage and want to be the best wife they can are often called a “Pick Me”. This is nonsense! Why wouldn’t a woman who seeks to fulfill the most important role ever as a wife and mother not want to have a good loving husband who honours her.

Think about it. Are the women who tell you this living the life you want?

Now, to set the record straight, being called a “Pick Me” is now a badge of honour. Trust me the men don’t see it in any negative way, and neither will your husband.

We are going to start with accepting and embracing your desire for marriage. As a traditional woman, you may feel like society doesn't value your dreams of finding a loving husband and starting a family. It's important to remember that your desires are natural and valid, regardless of what others may say.

Finding a partner takes work and dedication, it's not something that happens overnight. By accepting this reality and being willing to put in the effort, you can increase your chances of creating the life you want.

It's important to believe in yourself and the possibility of having a fulfilling relationship. It may feel overwhelming at times, but keeping a positive mindset and staying hopeful can help you stay motivated and focused on your goal.

By embracing your desire for marriage, you're taking a significant step towards achieving a lifestyle you can be comfortable and proud of. This chapter will provide you with the tools and support you need to overcome any doubts or shame you may be feeling.

### Overcoming Marriage Shaming
When it comes to wanting to get married, women often face criticism and judgment from others who typically do not share the same values or goals. The judgement often comes from scared, bitter women who haven’t taken responsibility for their shortcomings with men. 

You are not them!

You have decided to learn, reflect, and do the neces work to get what you want and need. Their words can be disheartening and hurtful, but it's important to recognize that these negative opinions do not reflect your worth as a person or the validity of your desire for marriage.

It's understandable that people have differing views on marriage, but it's crucial to remember that your goals and desires are just as important as anyone else's. No one can tell you what you should or shouldn't want for your life, and you shouldn't feel ashamed or guilty for wanting them. It's important to acknowledge and embrace your desire for marriage as a natural and healthy aspiration.

Finding a fulfilling marriage can be challenging and require effort, and it's worth it. Don't let the negative opinions of others discourage you from pursuing your goal. Remember that it takes work to achieve what you want in life (just like school), and that effort is worth it in the end. Trust yourself and your own judgment. Do not let others sway you from what you truly want. Your happiness and fulfillment are worth fighting for, so pursue your goals without fear of judgment or shame from women who try to make you feel less than.

### Hard Work and Faith
Embracing the reality that getting married is hard work requires acknowledging that being found by a suitable husband and building a healthy, lasting relationship takes effort, patience, and resilience. It means accepting that the process may involve disappointments, rejections, and setbacks. Progress may not always be as linear or as predictable as you may want it to be. However, it also means recognizing that the work put into finding and nurturing a fulfilling marriage is worthwhile and can lead to a lifetime of happiness, love, and companionship.

Having a solid belief and faith in oneself and in the possibility of beating the odds is crucial to staying motivated and persistent in the face of challenges and obstacles. Belief means having a conviction that it is possible to be found by a man who shares your vision, values, and goals. A man who is committed to building a strong and fulfilling relationship. Faith means trusting in one's ability to grow, learn, and adapt to the changing circumstances of modern culture and relationships.

By embracing the hard work that goes into finding a suitable partner and building a healthy, long-lasting relationship, and by cultivating a solid belief and faith in oneself you can approach the this process with a positive, resilient, and proactive mindset. This mindset can help them overcome the fears, doubts, and negative influences that may arise along the way. Stay focused on your vision and purpose of searching for a committed, fulfilling, and loving man for marriage.

## Chapter 3: Defining the Man
“Where are the good men?” a common question and point of frustration amongst many women today. So let me answer it for you. Most are married and the rest are much smaller pool than you have ever imagined. 

These men tend to not be seen because they keep themselves busy investing in spaces and people that will benefit their future. They don’t frequent the bars and clubs, are not loud and all over social media. But, there is core reason why you don’t know where your husband is and it’s all in your control.

You have never thought about him, described him, took time to investigate who the type of man you desire is as a human being beyond the lifestyle you would like for him to provide you.

Don’t stress. Breathe. I got you.

Now we delve into the intricacies of defining the man that you envision as your future husband. We will emphasize the significance of understanding what your man is seeking for in a wife. Gaining this insight will enhance the efficiency and effectiveness of your search. 

This chapter provides practical guidance on how to identify the important qualities in the desired man, and how to align them with your own needs and desires. This awareness and clarity will greatly increase your chances of finding a compatible partner and building a strong, fulfilling relationship.

The journey necessitates a profound understanding of oneself and one's relationship preferences. This chapter encourages the reader to reflect on her own needs, desires, and expectations, and to explore what your ideal man looks like. Armed with this understanding, you can approach the search with intentionality and focus, increasing the likelihood of success in finding a compatible match.

Furthermore, the chapter underscores the importance of recognizing that certain wants and needs must align with those of the man you desires. While this can be challenging, it is a crucial aspect of setting the groundwork for a potentially successful relationship. This chapter highlights the significance of being willing to compromise on certain wants, and understanding that mutual alignment and commitment are key to the progression of courtship into a successful marriage. I want to encourages you to approach this with curiosity, pragmatism, and an open heart, as it will pave the way towards your future husband.

### He Has Desires Too
Understanding what men are looking for in a wife is a crucial factor in achieving marital success. It requires diligent effort to identify the qualities and traits that men value most in a wife. This entails self-reflection, research, and seeking feedback from trusted individuals who prioritize your interests over theirs.

Considering the desires of your man is critical for two key reasons. Firstly, it enables a you to better identify the right partner for yourself by knowing what is important to the man you desires. In turn you can assess if you possesses those qualities and how they may foster alignment with yours and his values and needs. This knowledge also empowers you with the tools to avoid wasting time on incompatible men who do not share similar values.

Secondly, understanding a man's desires is essential for building a solid foundation in a marriage. It helps you as a future wife focus on developing the qualities that are important to your partner and align with your values, This fosters greater compatibility by aligning your needs and wants with those of his.

Understanding what your man is looking for in a wife requires intentional and proactive effort. It will get uncomfortable, it’s will stretch you. It involves taking responsibility for one's own happiness and actively working towards middle ground and acknowledging that you cannnot get everything. 

Yes, men settle and sacrifice. All good men do. 

By putting in the work to understand your man's desires, you set yourself up for success, so do not rush, skip, or runaway from the section of work. 

### Be in Alignment with Him
When you are seeking a husband, it's important for you to recognize that a successful relationship is founded on mutual understanding and respect. In the previous section, we emphasized the significance of comprehending the desires of the type of man you are interested in marrying. Once you have gained this understanding, it becomes crucial for you to ensure that your own needs and some of your wants align with his to set the stage for a prosperous marriage.

Aligning with the desires of your envisioned man sparks an intrigue in him to want to discover more about you as a potential wife. It signifies that you values his wants and needs, and are willing to make the necessary compromises to build on those connections. 

> Yes, as men (even the good ones) we get very set in our ways, but we try not to be for the women we value in our life.

This kind of consideration fosters trust, respect, and appreciation from a good man, making it easier to explore, collaborate, and overcome any challenges that may arise from courtship to marriage.

Ensuring alignment of your needs and some of your wants with your envisioned husband also enhances a your chances of being found and accepted by him. It enables you to avoid settling for someone who may not be a suitable match fundamentally — I’m talking character, not money or status. Instead focus on building a strong relationship with someone who shares in your morals, values, and outlook.

Having alignment with your husband-to-be promotes adaptability and flexibility in his mind, and yes this is important to us men. Compromise is inevitable in any relationship, and when you are willing to align your desires with his, it reflects your willingness to work together and become the lifelong support that all men crave.

Lastly, know that a good man will honour, respect, and make exceptions for you as his woman. As long as you remain loyal and strive to align with him, he will do his part to give you room and space to become and grow. But in order to get there your man need to see you as a cooperative and submissive to begin with.




## Chapter 4: Stand Out & Be Found
You cannot manifest a husband or have one just show up while you make minimum effort on your part. It requires work ladies, uncomfortable work, persistent work, hard work. Know that all of this work benefits you personally irregardless of the man showing up. 

Let’s call it investing in yourself and the future life you want to live. 

When a man has decided he is ready for marriage he chooses from the women around him. This is typically done through word of mouth within his social circles. If your name doesn’t come up as a candidate he will never know you exist and in turn another woman will be the wife of your husband. 

You are in competition for a husband against every other women who is in search of a man like yours. It’s best for you to drop the ego and accept this. There’s too few marriage minded men at any given time for all of you to get one exclusively.

> Yes ladies, you need to fight to get a chance at being a wife. 

In this pivotal chapter, we delve into the crucial step of being noticed as a homebody. You may have experienced challenges in meeting suitable men in the past and it has you extra cautious — not any more. It's also understandable to feel invisible or overshadowed by outgoing and extroverted women, but fear not, there are strategies to increase your visibility and make yourself more findable by men who are ready to be a husband and facilitate marriage.

We will explore practical ways to network and get your name out there, while remaining true to your authentic self and modesty. From creating opportunities to meet like-minded women to leveraging your interests and unique qualities, I will equip you with the tools to stand out in a genuine and meaningful way. We will also discuss the importance of exercising patience in your search, and how to build a supportive community of family, friends, colleagues, and acquaintances who are invested in your journey and desire to see you happily married.

> Yes, shooters shot! Make the first move if you get the chance. Remember, what you won’t do another woman will.

I am empowering you to proactively take control of your search for a husband and this does not make you for “the streets”. It's time to be seen, heard, and pursued by the right kind of men who can share in your vision of a lifelong and healthy marriage. Let's unlock your potential for a fulfilling and meaningful marriage. After all, love is worth the effort. So, let's dive in and make sure you stand out and be found by the man of your needs.

### Hindering Your Results
As a woman seeking a husband, staying at home and not going out severely limits your chances of being found by a man who is looking for a wife. It's not enough to rely solely on online platforms or introductions through close friends and family. To increase your chances of finding a committed relationship, you need to actively put yourself out there and be visible in social settings. People need to know of you and speak well of you for this to work. 

Attending events, joining groups or clubs, volunteering, or participating in activities that you enjoy are great ways to get started as long as they get you out of the house. Being an unknown homebody and not going out can and often does give the impression that you are not interested in meeting a man or you already have one. 

> We make these assumptions as men, take note.

Finding a partner requires effort and stepping out of your comfort zone. It's important to be open to new experiences and be willing to take risks in order to be found by your man. You don't have to compromise your values or change who you fundamentally are, but stretching yourself to experience new ways of being is nothing but upside for you.

As a woman who is serious about her search for a husband, you must be willing to take the necessary steps to make yourself visible and known. Being seen around is not enough, you need to have people speaking on the good of your character. This requires getting out of the house, engaging in social activities, and being proactive in your search. Finding a husband is not about luck, it’s about preparation and consistent action. 

### Increasing Your Chances
The list below is the groundwork for making moves. You need to outdo the other woman who is after your man. 

> We do not use dating apps, they are low investment environments. Good men, men of value invest themselves and their time. You won’t find them on apps like Tinder or Muzz.

This where you begin:
1. Join social groups and events: Even though you may prefer to stay home, it's important to get out and socialize if you want to be found by a man. Joining social groups, attending events, and participating in activities that interest you are healthy and beneficial activities.
2. Be approachable: It's important to be approachable and open to building new relationships with people especially women. Smile, make eye contact, and engage in conversation with those who show interest in you. Show that you're interested in learning more about them and their interests.
3. Build a supportive community: Building a community of friends and acquaintances who support your desire to find a husband. They need to act as your eyes and ears and be familiar with your requirements and red flags in a man.
4. Filter and update your friend group: Surround yourself with other women who are married and/or seeking marriage themselves. Your single friends will keep you single as they operate and view relationships differently. If all your closest friends are single you will more than likely remain single alongside them.
5.  Consider working with a matchmaker: This option will cost you financially, but with the right person can greatly reduce the time required searching. They will help you find someone who is compatible with you in terms of values, interests, and lifestyle.

### Take Chances and Be Patient
Looking for a husband is a challenging task that requires courage, persistence, and patience. It's natural to feel apprehensive about putting yourself out there and risking rejection, but it's essential to keep in mind that finding the right person is worth the risk. Don't let fear hold you back from taking the necessary steps to becoming the married woman with the man and the kids and the home you can invite your single friends over to.

> Imagine the life, feel it, let it drive you.

It's crucial to remain consistent in your efforts and stay patient, your persistence will pay off in the end under the conditions that you are doing the work. When you experience setbacks or rejection, use them as opportunities to learn and adjust your approach.

Remember that building a fulfilling and loving relationship takes time and effort. It all begins with being found and you actively searching. With a positive attitude, consistent effort, and a willingness to step out of your comfort zone, you can speed up and increase the probability of living that life you desire as a wife. 


## Chapter 5: Keeping the Momentum
You have done a lot of work to get here, I am proud of you! 

I want you to take a moment and appreciate yourself. Nothing I have asked you to do has been easy in any way. Yet, here you are nearing the finish line of our journey together.

It’s necessary that I remind you that this will take time. You will need to be consistent, you need to be intentional, and you will need to be compassionate. There will be up’s and downs and it is natural, trust me. 

> You have made this far, you make the rest. 

It's understandable that facing rejection or disappointment can lead to discouragement and loss of motivation, but it's crucial to keep up the momentum and maintain a determined and focused approach throughout the journey.

Working on your self-confidence and self-assurance is key, as these are attractive qualities that can help you stand out from the crowd. We'll also be addressing fears and insecurities that will and may already have arise with some exercises to manage them.

This is a process, and it's important to enjoy the journey rather than solely or obsessively focused on the destination. Keep an open mind and embrace new experiences because you never know where or when you might run into your future husband.

### Maintaining Self-assurance and Consistency
Building self-assurance and confidence is crucial in all areas of life, including relationships. When you have self-assurance men notice, and you radiate a welcoming energy that is attractive to us as men. We men are drawn to women who are self-assured and enjoying being who they are — shy or not.

Having self-assurance means that a woman knows her worth and is comfortable in all of who she is, the good and the bad. This kind of self-assurance is empowering and allows you to approach the search from a place of strength, grace, and security. Building and embracing self-assurance is more likely to attract men who are confident and secure in themselves.

Consistency is also important in building self-assurance and confidence. This means making a commitment to take action towards caring and challenging yourself every day, especially with the tiny things. Being consistent doesn’t mean boring you exercise consistency in being diverse in your sense of fashion or the places you frequent. Shake up the routine every now and then to maintain intrigue and excitement during this journey.

### Fears & Insecurities
I want you to know that it's perfectly normal to feel insecure you are trying something new, something different.  way. As a homebody, it can be especially challenging to step out of your comfort zone and actively seek a husband. Fear of rejection and anxiety about meeting new people are common emotions that many women and men feel.

> Yes ladies, we men have feels and insecurities too.

However, I encourage you not to let these fears and insecurities hinder your progress. You are capable of overcoming them and achieving your goal of experiencing a fulfilling and loving marriage. Remember that self-doubt is just a feelings, and feelings pass. 

Taking small steps forward and being mindful to care for yourself as a means of building self-assurance is the way to combat any insecurity. By doing so, you will slowly become more and more capable to handle any hurdles that arise. You are not alone in this, there many women in the same boat as you, and of course my self and my community are in your corner.

Be kind to yourself, give grace, take things one step at a time, and keep moving forward with determination and positivity. You are worthy of happiness and fulfillment in all areas of your life, especially your romantic life. With belief in yourself and a willingness to push through any obstacles, you will always find the strength to achieve.
