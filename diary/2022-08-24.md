@0504 I just realized I am becoming what and who I didn’t want to be a man of Dawah…

@0520 A lot of talk with Allah today… I will go shower now after another 10 push-ups Allahu Akbar . Oh, and then my morning pages.

@0545 I am hungry now… good get food! Then what? Decide my friend decide! I will write my morning pages with Allah to define my message an my plan moving forward. 

@0926 I watched the rest of DOTA Dragon’s Blood and I will need to watch this again because the script is astoundingly good. How did I miss this in the first 2 chapters.

@0628 I screwed up man! 

@0707 I am feeling anxious, extremely anxious and it’s getting me to think I am indecisive. This is nonsense, so I will decide quickly and act accordingly. Impact right now will be the release of the YouTube video now that it is finally up.
