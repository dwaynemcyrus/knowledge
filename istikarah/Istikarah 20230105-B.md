Guide me to manhood and how to achieve this during Umrah?

  

82:1

  

24:39 - Belief in Allah, and in your action for the sake of Allah

  

46:4 - Who and what are you holding higher than your belief and faith and trust in Allah. I think I do this with fear…sigh. 

  

52:47 - what came to me immediately was the thought of vengeance. Do I have this in my heart, second to that was…what wrong am I doing to others and MYSELF?

  

78:34 A full cup? Optimism, expecting goodness? Allah I do not understand.
