Value Creator is this for me, am I on the right path with my thinking?

  

59:20 It seems like as long as I am inline with Allah, which I am and I hold firm I will be successful. So then is this a confirmation ya rabb? [19-24] Do NOT forget Allah, keep him in mind at all times and in all things, always! Remember his names and understand the attributes of Allah. Allah knows all and see all. Do right.

  

101:11 A fiercely blazing fire… is this some good for me to create with? The urge for sure is intense and strong in my chest. [surah] The striking hour. Lean into the deeds of Good for you first and then others, no longer are you allowed to sin by wronging yourself.

  

19:57 Yes, doing this works inherently pushes me to live and be of the best of character, I know this. Even now ya rabb I attempt to hold strong and keep well. 

  

24:42 This! Allah this is the word “sovereignty “ I desire this Allah. This is what I am working towards Allah. It seems to me that I am in line Alhamdulillah. [37-51] Allah made you and every single thing, he provides like no other. Do not get clouded in doubt that pulls you away from doing the work. Your mind is here and it must stop doubting Allah.

  

38:69 I do not know what this is to mean Allah. [65-74-] To be like the Warner, to speak to educate, this is how you will find your success. Hold to the Qur’an, teach on that sourced from the Qur’an.
