### The Direction
*"O Allah! I seek goodness from Your Knowledge and with Your Power (and Might) I seek strength, and I ask from You Your Great Blessings, because You have the Power and I do not have the power. You Know everything and I do not know, and You have knowledge of the unseen. Oh Allah! If in Your Knowledge this action…*

**of fulfilling the goal of 12'000 committed and engaged black men, 12'000'000 supporters of my art, which generates 240'000 CHF in reoccurring profits by serving through guidance towards righteous transformation for sovereign living by Sha'ban 25 1447 (February 13 2026) — refer to today's journal entry**

*...is better for my religion and faith, for my life and end death, for here in this world and the hereafter then make it destined for me and make it easy for me and then add blessings baraka' in it, for me. O Allah! In Your Knowledge if this action is bad for me, bad for my religion and faith, for my life and end death, for here in this world and the hereafter then turn it away from me and turn me away from it and whatever is better for me, ordain destine that for me and then make me satisfied with it."*
### The Response
**The Declining Day, Epoch**
103:2 Yes, I do feel lost, and this is why I am turning to you my lord. I am your servant and I need to submit to your will. I am struggling to.
103:1-3 You will and are no long lost wants you return to advising those to truth and righteousness in their behaviour. Damn…the work I am to speak. Allah SWT is telling me directly how to no longer be lost. 

**The Winnowing Winds**
51:54 I believe this is about not being around those who do not believe and do not care to listen. Stay away from them, do not be concerned for them. 
51: 52-56 Be the reminder for the people and do not stay where you are not wanted. Do not force anything, just speak. Reminders profit the believers and in turn will profit you. Much like when you needed to get here for marriage your travels were assisted and for Mecca and Medina trip. 
Submit then believe.

**The Dawn**
113:3 Your protection? Speaking and aiding the people. Reminding them of righteousness.
113: Surah Your path forward at the break of dawn everyday this is your work to be done, to speak and put forth advisement for the people. Remember when you said you must make your daily earning from morning to Dhuhr, this is it. 
Your start. 
### The Understanding
Think and remember the day of judgement and separate yourself from the non-believers. Today, is your return to the path of Allah SWT for your work and there is to be no doubts about it. Do it. Do it now, do it today, by dawn my brother. At Dawn.

### The Reflection
> Indeed, mankind is in loss,
> So leave them, for you are not to be blamed.
> And from the evil of darkness when it settles
