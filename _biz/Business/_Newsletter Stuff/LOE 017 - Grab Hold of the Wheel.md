**My Voyager,**

You are the captain of your life.

No one else, but you.

Far too often we waste our time in imagination. Thinking of all the ways we have been hurt or can get hurt. 

In doing this we let go of the wheel and our life (your ship) becomes captain-less. Blowing in the wind if you will, literally moved day-in and day-out by our emotions and the demands of others. 

I want you to know that you do not need to live like this, and the solution is simple. 

GRAB HOLD OF THE WHEEL! 

You have done it before. You can and will do it again. 

Do not wait until life forces you to grab hold of the wheel. 

Grab the wheel because you have decided that YOU have somewhere YOU need to go. 

I love you and I believe in you.

With Gratitude,
*Talha ibn Cyrus*
