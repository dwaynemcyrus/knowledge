### The reality of wealth
* The rich don't work harder than you, the poor do and are working on the wrong things
* Working hard is not the secret to wealth
* Your mindset of money needs to be loving healthy and good
* The rich live off the backs of the poor!

### Applications of effort
* Everything you know where did you learn it from?
* Are the people who teach program your mind rich, they work in the Matrix
* “it doesn't matter how hard you dig if you are searching for gold where there is none”
* Life begins when you are rich, that's why you must get rich fast, until then it is slavery
* How can people teach you where you want to go if they have never been there?
* “common advice will not make you an uncommon individual” everyone knows so why would it work
* If the person teaching you has nothing you want from how they live they have nothing to teach you
* Aspire to have fiscal freedom the only alternative is to be a save

### The real problem
* Every second of the day you are being taxed to be a slave
    * To work are and be taxed on it
* The matrix is not iron bars it's a prison for your mind
* Everything you are is from your experiences, this is programing it cannot be stopped but you can chose who and what does it
* Choose your experience, do not be closed minded

### You have a choice
* Choose what you see and here
* No one takes advantage of this choice but you can
* Be selective, choose people who are outside of the matrix
* People in the Matrix show no resistance to it, the bend to it

### Selective programming
* This is your super power
* Surround yourself areound people who talk about money! Daily!
* Analyze money, constantly look for where money can be made
* “water is like money, it's always moving, only the poor think it is pooled”
* Think about everything you have learned… who taught you that?
* You have a choice to only accept knowledge from those who benefit you, those who are outside the Matrix, and those who have qualities you admire

* 120k is nothing a year
* Remove the slave mind the man working the good job is a slave
* The old way to become rich is a lie by design, garbage by design
* Disaster and opportunity is the same thing
* Outside the Matrix COVID made the best money, while those in it for poorer
* Crisis and opportunity is the same word in Japanese, is it?
* It's about the new ways of making money the old don't work
* Making the money is not hard
* If you want to live outside of the matrix you have to accept it is real and be actively working to escape it
* “The law of association is the backbone of modern learning theory. If I listen to people who have he life I want, i’m more likely to achieve it.”the genius 1%
