### Pain
Primary:
Time is running out and I am alone, unmarried and childless.

Secondary:

### Problem
How do I find, identify, attract, and keep a good man?

### Profile
Financially successful traditionally raised woman who has experienced a number of failed relationships after she left a good marriage-minded man in her mid to late 20’s. Believing that she is and can do better than him after seeing the online lives of the single “hot-girl summer” women. 

Now in her early to mid 30’s she’s begun to realize that all of the information she has been told about men, family, and career. Desperate to have a husband and family, no longer satisfied by the single woman lifestyle and corporate stress. 

She is now frantically looking for the answers to having a husband and family, but the modern conditioning remains very strong in her, back by pure fear of the unknown, men.

### Day in the Life


## Current vs Dream State
### Current
Single, alone, and desperate. Hiding her feeling of inadecuacy in being a women that a men whats to marriage and not just lay with. Filled with resentment and shame for not knowing what women should know, how to attract a man and keep him. 
Her need for companion ship is growing more intense by the day, slowly eating away at her self-worth. Envious of the women online who post their videos about motherhood and being a wife.
Extremely frustrated she spends her nights stressed, drinking, wallowing in her lonliness while she makes desperate attempts at online date and learning about men from other women. Every night she questions hers self, “why can’t i find a man?”.

### Dream
Married to a good man with traditional values and kids running around her home. Documenting her outings and vacations with her family like the other married women do. No longer feeling alone and spoken about as a “[[left-over woman]]” or “broken” for not being able to secure a man.

Her friend group is conposed of other stay-at-home mothers who host meetups and outings. She’s officially apart of the group of women who are truly successful. No longer on the outside envious of the life they live, that she could not solve. 
Her husband is a good man that other women want. He leads her and the family with respect, discipline, and kindness. She is truly at peace because of his presence, living the [[true soft]] life.
