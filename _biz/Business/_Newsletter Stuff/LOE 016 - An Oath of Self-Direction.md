**As-Salaamu Alaikum**,
My fellow Voyagers, I hope this week’s letter finds you in a good place and in safety.

Let us begin.

## The Problem: Committing to a new life after trauma
You have left the cage of trauma, abuse, self-doubt, and anguish.  

Out in the world feeling a bit lost, uncertain, and unclear as to the best direction to move in. 

Analysis paralysis sets in and you freeze. Your life freezes. You only go through the motions repeating the same actions out of comfort and familiarity.

You desire a better life, knowing that you are capable of one. 

Yet, you remain, life remains, the same old stories remain.

Direction is what you need and you have taken it from many people, each giving results, but none ever touching what you truly long for to feel fulfilled. 

Your problem is this…

Only YOU can direct you life.

You must be the one, the only one to set the destination of your voyage.

This is why nothing has worked, you have been following the direction of those who have not lived your life, nor do they know or understand your desires, needs, and wants.

Together, you and I will solve this in this very letter.

## How I Did It (Personal Experience)
*“I have to kill myself…”*

I said this to myself bent over in tears, emotionally exhausted, and angry with myself, angry with God.

*“Ya Allah I am tired, I am tired of being this way, living this way. Why can I not just love myself and do what others do?”* 

TO BE SELFISH. To live on my terms, doing what I want, and not sacrificing for others to the point of my own destruction.

I cried…

I cried a lot and for a long time in a small dark room in silence.

I broke, and it was necessary. 

The need to finally admit to myself that my **neglect of self** in order to “fit-in” or be “accepted” was not working and it never has. A coping and survival tactic from years past in a hostile environment. I am no longer the child, the victim, the survivor, the strength and glue for the family I was born into.

Now I am the adult, a weakened adult, a tired adult, a man who has been through much and would like to rest now. 

Rest is not an option and neither is quitting.

In my feels, on my prayer mat, in the dark, I allowed for the tears and pain to pour out of me. Tormented by the experience of my emotions I stayed with it. I wanted to run from myself, to shut it down, to “man up”.

I did no such thing.

I felt it all.

Every drop, every breathe, every quiver. I fought myself to experience this pain that I have been carrying.

*“I have to kill myself”*

This was the understanding and decision I came to at the end of my tears. The man that I had become needs to be sacrificed to the man that I am now, for the man I am becoming. 

This marked the beginning of the end. 

I made a commitment that very night which was the genesis of my declaration to become an unbound self-sufficient man in all realms of the human experience.

A life on my terms and my terms alone.

You can make this decision yourself, and begin to walk the path of a life that is experienced on your terms towards self-actualization, complete safety in self-expression…sovereignty.

The trauma of your past as a child and/or adult does not need to dictate the person you are and in turn the life that you lead.

You can end it today. Right here, right now.
## Making the Decision (Solution in Steps)
You need to put your life into writing and make an oath to yourself and your God. 

If you do not write this out, it will only ever remains a thought, a dream, a feeling, but never reality.

How you start sets the tone. Make it real now, paper and pen. 

This is the beginning. 

You must tell your mind, *“This is our new reality!”*

Before I share with you what I did to set the stage, I need you to understand that we are making a decision when we do this. NOT A CHOICE.

> **Choice:** an act of choosing between two or more possibilities
> **Decision:** a conclusion or resolution reached after consideration

To make a choice is to act upon the options that are presented to you. This is how you have been living and it ends today.

By the end of you reading this I want you to make a decision. To act on what you desire even though it is not currently an option. This is where your new life starts, this is where YOU begin.
#### Step 01
Grab a pen a paper and go to a place where you will not be disturbed or distracted for the next 20-40 minutes. When you are there I need you to envision and feel the life you want to live in the next 10 years. Do not go beyond that.

Close your eyes, breath, and BE SELFISH.

Answer this single question, “How do I want to be experiencing my life in the next 12 years?”

You want to feel this in your soul. Don’t run away from how grand or “impossible” it may seem. Just focus on what it is that you want, paint it in your mind and with your emotions.
#### Steps 02
Write it out in detail, describe this life in your own words. Do not filter yourself, or make the vision any smaller because of disbelief.

As best as you can continue to feel the vision, stick with the positive emotions. Let any negative emotion know that they can have their time after this exercise.

**Bonus:** Draw it out. It does not matter what skill level you are we can all put an image to paper, I encourage you to do this. No one else needs to be aware of its existence, but you. 

Matter of fact it’s best that you safeguard the results of this exercise from 97.5% of the people in your life. Most simply wont understand! Out of fear and wanting to “protect” you they speak doubt into your soul.

You are birthing a new you, the true you, a you that must be protected at all cost and by any means.
#### Step 03
It’s time for you to make the declaration to self and to God. 

Grab that pen and paper, keep it brief, make it personal to you. When you read it back to yourself, it must only make sense when applied to you, no one else.

This will be the contract that you will sign and date at the end. Make sure to sign and date this is very important.
#### Step 04
Make sure that you have a physical copy and a digital copy that is with you at all times. You will be reviewing this vision and oath every single day, twice a day at minimum. 

Once when you wake, and once before you sleep.

This is NOT optional, this is your LIFE that you are CREATING. This is your VOYAGE you must take you seriously.

Calendar the time, set alarms, whatever it will take to ensure that you read these two documents out loud to yourself everyday.
### Step 05
Set yourself another block of time every singe day for at least 15 minutes. During this time is where you will practice nurturing and clearing a way towards your vision.

This can be planning, brainstorming ideas, or simply reinforcing the vision with day dreams. The point is to get into the habit of walking towards the life you desire and are more than capable of creating.

This time is best blocked out in the early mornings when the distractions and demands of the world have yet to show themselves. 

Wake up 15 minutes earlier to accommodate for this. Remember this is your life that you are creating, on your terms, for your future.

You must sacrifice who you are now, for who you are becoming.
## Final Thoughts
As uncomfortable as it may feel, and as impossible as it may seem…

**YOU CAN CREATE THIS.**

If you couldn’t achieve the vision you had written out it would have never come to your mind.

Allow this to be your new obsession for the next 9 months. 

You are now officially pregnant with the you that needs to come to life and begin to live in this world.

I encourage you to email back and share your experience with the first of many exercises with me as a *Voyager*.

You are not alone, I am on the same journey just a little ahead. 

You got this.

I got this.

We got this.

Together, you and I will achieve what many only dream of and are far too afraid to admit.

Imagine 9 months from now YOU will emerge, and the frustrated unfulfilled version of you will cease to exist.

With Gratitude,
*Talha ibn Cyrus*
