Make the goal a prominent feature in your work area to keep in sharp in your mind to visualize it. And visualize it as much as possible daily.

Make a list of the learning materials that you will need to achieve your goal. Use his [starter pack]() as a base to collect all of your required material.

Place your learning materials in an order that you will follow like a curriculum. Make a study schedule for your art studies using his example image below.

Make smaller goals for your work study to keep you motivated. Like 100 heads is a week, 5 portfolio pieces, etc. 

Document and share your progress. Save each sketchbook and organize them by date.

There is no such things as true self-taught artists, the input of others is key to growth.

The main obstacle to achieving goals is often just ourselves.
