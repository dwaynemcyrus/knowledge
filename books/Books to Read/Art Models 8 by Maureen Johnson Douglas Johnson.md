description: Whether for work on a finished piece, trying a new technique, or getting in some practice time, artists can work when and where they want using the Art Models series. Chosen specifically for artists who sell their work, Art Models 8 features 174 all-new figure studies by 55 different models, both male and female, that represent a wide range of physiques and diversity. The poses include individuals and couples in natural, relaxed postures—from standing and sitting to lying down. A judicious amount of photo retouching has been done, not to make the models more glamorous, but to remove distractions. The PC- and Mac-compatible DVD-ROM included in the book features high-resolution photos in JPG format. This popular image format allows the photos to be viewed and manipulated in any way an artist might find useful, such as combining images or rotating them. Images can be viewed on a computer screen, printed out, projected for a group, or via a high-definition television. Each angle of every pose may also be enlarged, enabling artists to zoom in on specific body parts to achieve a higher level of detail.
