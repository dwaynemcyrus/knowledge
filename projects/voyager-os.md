## Vision
Voyager OS — or **V-OS** — is a design-engineered rethink of digital productivity.  
It merges elegant interface design with deep personal systems thinking.  
The app’s foundation is privacy-first and Apple-native, blending local storage, smooth animations, and optional iCloud sync.

## Core Concepts
- **Task Flow:** Create, organize, and prioritize with contextual views (Today, Rituals, Missions).  
- **Life Dashboard:** Visualize goals, habits, reflections, and journal entries in one place.  
- **AI Scheduling Assistant:** Suggests optimal times for work, rest, or reflection using local context and personal history.  
- **Ritual Mode:** A minimal full-screen focus timer that opens and closes each work session with intention.  
- **Sync Layer:** CloudKit-based optional sync; all data encrypted and local-first by default.

## Technical Highlights
- Built initially with **Astro + React Islands** for web prototype.
- Will later transition to a **SwiftUI + CoreData** native app.
- AI functions powered by **local LLMs (MLX)** or OpenAI API.
- IndexedDB for offline task persistence in the browser.
- Uses **Tailwind utility layers** for clean, scalable component design.

## Portfolio Purpose
Voyager OS demonstrates:
- System design and product architecture thinking  
- Advanced UI/UX craft (Apple Human Interface-inspired)  
- AI augmentation for real-world utility  
- Integration of habit, time, and reflection into a single cohesive system
