You are worthy of loving yourself like no other. 

There is a a time and place for you to take up space and it is right now and at all times. 

There is no need for you to be small. 

Be big, extremely big. No LARGE! 

Better still enormous. No that’s not large enough you need to be righteous!

God covers you, stop getting in the way.
