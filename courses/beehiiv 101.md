**“The decoy effect describes how, when we are choosing between two alternatives, the addition of a third, less attractive option (the decoy) can influence our perception of the original two choices.” -** **[The Decision Lab](https://thedecisionlab.com/biases/decoy-effect?utm_source=academy.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=pages)**


The Anchoring effect is a cognitive bias that causes us to rely heavily on the first piece of information we are given. A famous example is when Steve Jobs kept the $999 price up on the screen and then smashed it to $499. The crowd went wild _(even though $499 was the price Jobs intended the whole time)_.


## Leverage the LISH (Length Implies Strength Heuristic)

First of all, what in the world is a heuristic? 

A heuristic is our brain’s way of creating mental shortcuts for making decisions. It takes a lot of effort to power the personal supercomputers sitting between our ears — so our brains developed this ability to avoid thinking deeply about things _(because you know… think hard make head hurt)._

Enter: Length Implies Strength Heuristic or LISH. Put simply, the more social proof and testimonials you include, the more likely your subscribers will think there’s something to it. 

_(Lot words make head hurt)_

Many newsletter writers confuse building an audience with building a community. 

What’s the difference? 

|   |   |
|---|---|
|• An audience is one to many. <br><br>• An audience is a single broadcasted message. <br><br>• An audience is a one-way street.|→ A community is many to many. <br><br>→ A community is many messages. <br><br>→ A community is many streets.|

You get the point. Comments allow you to create a community around your newsletter.
