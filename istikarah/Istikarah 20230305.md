**Istikarah** 

  

4:93 so this is about me killing myself with poor treatment isn’t it. So I need to act better, do better , be better. Or does this mean going the path of writer is bad for me and that I should art it up? Help me understand Allah

  

40:8 This is clearly a reminder to my current situation with my mother to be righteous. I even asked Allah a few minutes ago in Salat to keep my heart soft. But how does this relate to writing my Allah. // 7-9 so continue to ask Allah for forgiveness on the part of others. 

  

80:9 Allah… what does this mean? // 3-16 Only remain in fear of Allah, NOT your mother or anyone else’s opinion you must act!!! You must stay in remember of Allah through Salat and Qur’an, return yourself to proper habits. 

  

75:4 Allah you are all knowing I understand, so tell me… what about my writing ya Rabb? -/ 1-12 Your escape is in Allah your soul and then your mind. Okay so Allah you are clearly giving me what I need right now . I will not fight. I will believe and trust. 

  

31:14 Continue to give gratitude to your mother through all this be easy. // 12-16 Be grateful to Allah be kind to your mother and do not follow in her or allow her behaviour to change you and yours. Show gratitude to Allah for all that you have , so in turn I guess that would mean take advantage of the TRW and the group make moves my friend! 

  

Summary: seperate yourself from you mother with love and kindness and be grateful for all that you have and make use of those resources available to you. Words and art and voice!
