## Experiences and Gratitude
Below are the categories of things to consider gratitude for...you can make your own of course. A number of these areas can be pulled in from other databases for the statistics. Think along the lines of what you did…Take some time to celebrate the big & small wins. If needed, look through your 📷 roll / journal.
List the top 3-6, the minimum is mandatory.
### I am thankful for...
* Souen accepting me to be her husband and taking me into her home and life.
* Noah and Aiyana giving me the opportunity to be their dad.
* Khal's support for the job at Cascades, the home which allowed me to take time to just exist in peace, and his support in moving to Switzerland.
* Dorothy's guidance from Allah in my direction for my career and the pursuit of Souen for marriage with haste like a lightening bolt.
### I am proud of...
* Trusting in Allah and making the move to leave Canada and start a new life for myself in Europe with my new wife and 2 kids.
* Leaving the house and the literal closet of a room with my mother and sister for a better life for myself so that I can become a better brother and son to them.
* Deciding to accept my role as a voice for the Ummah and messenger for the betterment of the family unit through the betterment of men.
### I overcame...
* The false belief that I cannot make a complete career change into what I am most passionate about which is the development of myself as a man while showing others.
* The fear of creating and selling my artwork by starting A Muslim Artist and actually selling some prints.
* I got back into live streaming and helping others as a guide, I didn't think I could do it, but I did and it landed me an interview about my abuse.
### People to acknowledge...
* Khal: This guy, just always supporting me in every single way possible, from a job to housing to money to emotions, just everything.
* Nadeem: For being a guide and encouragement for me to pursuit being a writer and speaker and well known public figure with his guidance. I do need to reach back out to him to see if he would be willing to work with me again to complete what we started.
* Dorothy: For giving me the message from Allah Allah SWT to pursuit my wife and to speak and guide for my career.
* Charles: What can I say, he has given me encouragement to be apart of his work leading men, and of course remaining a constant for me no matter how many times I have fallen and hidden myself away.
* Uncle Mike: Presenting and giving himself to me as a father figure that I can turn to for support and guidance his words to me always being, "give yourself grace".
* Damian: For encouraging me to pursuit Souen and to leave for Switzerland.
### Experiences of the world...
* Travelled from Canada on a 14 hour flight to Switzerland.
* Learned of other cultures primarily from Africa through the online community I had built on TikTok before my account was permanently banned.
* Living on my own as a bachelor, but in peace, real peace with zero compromise.
### Experiences of success...
* Sold multiple copies of my first book The Hidden Wife.
* Married the woman I wrote about and she's much more than I COULD HAVE EVER IMAGINED!
* Built such a reputation on TikTok that when I got banned people were shocked and would still talk about me in an extremely positive light of my character.
* Interviewed to tell me story of being a survivor of sexual abuse with 10k views on the video and over 100 comments of support and positivity.
* Getting my teeth cared for and corrected.
### Experiences of failure...
* Falling into a state of aimlessness, no goal, no movement once my TikTok account had been banned.
* Not maintaining consistency with my salat and reading of Qur'an.
* Not keeping my word to my sister by keeping up communications and not making her feel abandoned again. I hate that I have caused this again.
### Game changing experiences…
* Becoming a husband and a dad of two, an 11year old boy and a 4 year old girl
* The many lives I hosted where I lead and taught others how to be better humans, while making room for their stories to be heard.
### Purchases of joy...

## Lessons and Discoveries
### Learned about myself…
* I need to put all of my faith and belief in Allah SWT for all things, it always works I am given.
* When I want something, and I focus all of my efforts, I get it and I get it pretty quickly and with little resistance.
* Who I am is one who is to be honoured, followed, and seen, people gravitate to me, it's just that simple.
* I am the brand, the business, the message, and the messenger.
### Learned about others...
* People in general are looking for others to lead them.
* No one who is truly living a fulfilling life would give you advice rooted in fear and lack.
* Our childhood traumas really do shape how we experience life as young adults onwards.
### Learned about life…
* You really can change your life in what feels like an instant in an extreme way.
* What you think about and believe literally makes or breaks you.
* Nothing is permanent, you loose and or let go of ever single thing you know and own and still be fine.
* Humans have an extremely good ability to adapt quickly as long as we accept the changes we presented.

## Felt And Still Feel
**To get you started:** How are you really? Remember, there’s no right or wrong way to feel — all feelings are valid. What feelings did I feel? Were there any reoccurring patterns?
* Overwhelmed and excited with my new life and responsibilities as a husband and dad of two.
* Nervous and anxious about leaving everything in Canada to come to Switzerland.
* Capable of making the difference for Souen and the kids now that I am here, but also hesitant that I will make it.
* Excited to embark on this single focused mission of becoming a coach and content creator and illustrator.
* Caught between the joy of being with the family and taking over the world as a man.
* I feel like I have the direction and the goal and just not taking the steps the risk ya know, making the move.
* I feel grateful for my current life and also ashamed of how I been living without proper worship of Allah SWT.
* Still feel like a loser for not making money like a real man, ya know. Especially now that I have an entire family, from one single man to a wife and two kids.
* Loneliness, that was a new feeling that came about.
### Did I allow myself to lean into these feelings? Why or why not?
* I'm learning to lean into the excitement and joy of being a husband and dad.
* I leaned into the move as I am not in Switzerland.
* Starting to lean into being a coach by starting this new business.
* I have not embraced being an illustrator yet, sadly.
* Being more grateful is necessary and I owe this to myself as that is my responsibility as a Muslim.
* Trying not to lean into the feeling of being a loser (the shame) of a man because of lack of money making and low income of my past.
* More shame for being in hiding again from people because I do not feel worthy being who I am.
### Which of these feelings would I like to let go of, and which would I like to take with you into the new year?
#### Let Go
* Shame for falling into being a hider again from people and not connecting, sigh my stupid behaviour that causes me so much harm.
* Loser for not being a great financial earner and providing for my family and those I care for.
* Uncertainty in my decision making and action taking.
#### Bring Forward
* Excitement for being a husband, dad, artist, coach, and leader.
* Gratitude for my life and the opportunities Allah Allah SWT has given me.
* Creativity for being an artist and creator.
#### Shame you carry and the acts to turn them into pride…
* Not earning great money to support myself and family with what they want and need: Put yourself out into the world and serve others with the value that you have in order to give to others.
* Wasting my time and life not living on purpose: Everyday you need to have spent meaningful time working towards an aspect of your purpose.
* The state of my body, its lack of health, flexibility, and strength: Get deep into calisthenics, body building, strength & mobility training, along with a proper healthy diet.
* Not keeping my word to myself and in-turn others: Become a man of your word, by treating everything thing you say as a command to be fulfilled by God.
### Stupid Payoffs…
**To get you started:** What are the severely stupid things you are doing, that you know you should change, and could change to better your life?
 **The Stupid:** Not networking with new people and nurturing my existing relationships with other men I admire.
* The Payoff: Perpetuating my loneliness and keeping up the mentality that I cannot have healthy relationships with men that benefit both parties.
* The Change: Everyday you need to reach out to one man that you know and one man that you do not know.

**The Stupid:** Not remaining committed to my 20% daily routine.
* The Payoff: I get to be a loser and blame myself for remaining the same.
* The Change: Write your 20% routine that you got from your first Ramadan and start to implement it immediately.
 
 **The Stupid:** Putting myself on a clearly defined work schedule to earn money consistently and independently.
* The Payoff: Remaining poor and continuing to be able to degrade myself as a man along with not taking care of myself so that I still feel unworthy.
* The Change: Create a 6 day work schedule for yourself that is known to your wife and commit to it.

**The Stupid:** Not making time to train as an artist.
-  The Payoff: I continue to get to keep the mentality that I am never going to be good enough to be an artist and that my childhood is correct.
- The Change: Commit yourself to daily training for 1-2 hours of art. The Stupid: Not making time to learn and study for self improvement.
- The Payoff: I do not develop my mind, nor do i develop who I am and get to remain stuck, not taking on the responsibility of being a great man.
- The Change: Dedicated time to study, reflection, and mediation on a daily basis.
 
 **The Stupid:** Not live streaming and making content with my previous streams.
* The Payoff: I get to hide my brilliance and keep myself as a closeted brilliant man who the world needs and desires the attention of.
* The Change: Dedicated time each week to the research, preparation, production, and distribution of content.
 
 **The Stupid:** Not implementing content strategy I made with Khalvin.
* The Payoff: I get to continue to day dream about being a content creator instead of simply creating which I already know how to do.
* The Change: Review and implement the content strategy that you wrote with aim to hit each week for production.
 
 **The Stupid:** Remaining in debt to others personally and commercially.
* The Payoff: Another aspect of life that I get to reflect on and beat myself up for while also keeping my living standards and financial health poor.
* The Change: Pay off all of your debts quickly, earn, earn more, earn a lot more to clear it all especially as a Muslim.
 
 **The Stupid:** Not continuing to nurture my personal brand.
* The Payoff: Getting to hide my greatness and more importantly maintain the false story of being worthless and unworthy of greatness.
* The Change: Develop a brand plan based on your pre-existing notes in ChatGPT and the content from Dan Koe on a daily basis using social media. Produce daily using your existing content, make this your job.
### Jealousy Mapping…
**To get you started:** Think about the people you wish you could be like or do what it is you see them doing.
* Dan Koe: Making digital content that helps people while being paid over $60k/month working 2-4 hours a day writing.
* Takashi Murakami: Who creates artwork that lives in the high-end art world along with the everyday commercialized consumer in the low with great and wide appeal.

* Kai Cenat: Becoming a household name with immense influence as a live streamer and public figure.
* Nicolas Cole: To write so effectively that I retain attention and drive action with words alone.
### Held anger…
Who and what are you angry at? Who are you holding responsible?
* I am angry with myself and I hold myself responsible for all that is in my life that I am unhappy with. I no longer think of my past people (parents) in my life and experiences (trauma) responsible. I have done enough work on myself, to be able to just say, "hey, it's all on you now, you are recovered ad strong enough now, you got this".
### Limiting beliefs...
To get you started: Limiting beliefs are thoughts, opinions that one believes to be the absolute truth. They tend to have a negative impact on one's life by stopping them from moving forward and growing on a personal and professional level.

**These beliefs needs to be killed off!**
* Earning a high income will lead me to being a corrupt man and end up in bad situation like what I saw with my dad and family.
* Making art is bad for you, because it was bad for you as a child as it lead to not nice memories.
* You are unworthy of being seen, so anything that makes you seen is dangerous and should not be done.
* No matter how good you make something it will never be enough, you mom taught you this, so why bother even making.
