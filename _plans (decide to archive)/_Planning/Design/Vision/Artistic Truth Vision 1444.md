## Akhirah
Telling the truth in mediums that are not gated b language may help others have more understand and feel seen, which can soften hearts.
### Problems
This is a list of the major issues you see in the world that this work is meant to address over the years:
- “Black” artists are not in circulation within the high-end art market more representation is needed
- The painful realities of men and boys of sexual abuse do not hold a space in society that has people caring or even aware
- The realities of “Black” culture are not critiqued in a manner that either brings change of the faults or acknowledgments of its strengths
- History is only told from a European perspective and that needs to be challenged to get a more balanced truth of what happened
- The hyena society needs to be spoken on and addressed, the women are out of order
## Vision
Artwork crosses various mediums and sizes held in galleries and exhibits around the world next to the works of [[The Council]]. My works are highly regarded for their controversial truths on the realities of men and society that the world prefers to ignore. 
Prolific in my work as a voice for the unheard critiquing the powers at be in these areas of the human experience: 
- Our hyena society
- Various forms of abuse
- Painful realities of men
- New perspectives on historic events
- The trash of “black” culture
- Expressions of the neurodivergent mind
My works require a team of production artists to bring them to life. As the artist my works and name is renowned in the world of both popular culture and high fine arts.
The IPs I have created achieve massive recognition and collaboration.
### Impact After Death
Society has become aware of the power of “black” artists and find comfort and inspiration in supporting the voices of fellow artists of colour who are challenging and exposing cultural wrongs irregardless of religion. 
A new movement has started in prioritizing the collecting and fostering of controversial “Black” talent into the high-end art market. More creative men are taking their creativity and making use of it to share their experiences, to have a voice to be heard.
