description: Selling is a basic human interaction. Yet, most professionals in advertising and related fields understand very little about what actually drives people to buy. In this short, punchy book, Drew Eric Whitman lifts the shroud of mystery surrounding consumer behavior by explaining some fundamental psychological principles. His well-researched pointers will help you create ads that appeal to customers' deepest desires and impulses. Although Whitman's advice is applicable to all modes of advertising, he focuses on print advertising; thus, some readers might wish for more insights on Web copy or broadcasting. Still, getAbstract strongly recommends Whitman's compelling delivery of crucial advertising advice.
