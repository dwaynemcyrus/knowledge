I need a plan, like a step by step plan to get myself in order. I have become zombie-like, work sleep work sleep, check phone in between. 

There’s absolutely nothing good about this!

Now keep in mind you have been fighting an intense infection and still are. Grace is required.

Okay, so the plan is what?

@2139
As for a plan, well what is the problem you need to solve?

@2146
Your biggest problem right now? Not earning enough income. No bigger problem my Salat is off! That is a huge problem. 

It really is! 

So what’s the solution? Have set sleep hours and alarms for Salat!
