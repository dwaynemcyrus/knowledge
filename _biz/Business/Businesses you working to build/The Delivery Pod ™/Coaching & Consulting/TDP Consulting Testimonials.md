> Cyrus is an emotional  intelligent, professional , kind, caring, nonjudgmental, great listener, a friend. His skill set combined with his compassion and unique ability to make one feel safe is like no other. Was recently taking theropy with another source and came to a wall at one point. I needed more tools to help with my circumstances and Cyrus handed me great recommendations to cope and heal onward. He understood and validated my concerns while providing practical tools for positive change. I implemented and made use of most of his guidance till this day to cope with worries or stresses of life and it has helped tremendously with getting over my ptsd. I’m grateful to have had reached out to such a humble human being overall. Such an inspiration and wonderful impact in the field of mental health. He really cares, and will give you the solid core advice without hesitation. Such a genuine being. Would highly recommend to anyone who’s searching for relief.

> I had an opportunity to voice out some concerns regarding some personal matters and Brother Cyrus did the very thing that I need which was yo listen without judgement.  I felt my concerns were validated and was given good advice on how to handle myself emotionally and how to try and move forward. I felt very empowered and definitely felt some comfort in that there will be an end to the trials and tribulations. Its not often that a male can consider the female perspective on life issues and Brother Cyrus does that very well
