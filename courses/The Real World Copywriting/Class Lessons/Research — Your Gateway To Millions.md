## Notes
### Research
- “If I only had an hour to chop on the tree, I would spend the first 45 minutes sharpening my axe.” - Abraham Lincoln
- Being able to research allows you to work with any industry, it’s fundamental that you become proficient at this.
#### The mark of a professional copywriter
- Your ability to research gives your writing potency and sets you apart from the others, this is like running, it's core to the craft ya know.
- **Writing without research is pointless, similar to design without research, it is not enough effective, it’s empty**
- Your research is your ammunition 
- Professionals research then win, they seek to understand the avatar, the problem, and the product. You want as much clarity on the current to dream state process as possible.
#### Target Market
1.  Sit with the client and ask "who is your best customer the one you would call 1000 times?" 
2.  If not that then the top types of customers of the client.
3.  If not that then you reverse engineer from the knowledge you have to identify your target.
#### Avatar
- Go out and find information about these people
- Talk to them in the real world, see how they are online, etc

#### Current State
- Questions to add
	- What do they fear?
	- What do they lie awake at night worrying about?
	- What words do they use to describe their pains and frustrations? This is very important! 
	- How are they perceived: self, work, family, strangers on the street 
- As a copywriter you want to be in the mind of the reader, write from what and how they speak to themselves because it convinces them that they are understood 
- As a marketer, we don’t convince we just find what they are already unhappy with and work from there
#### Dream state 
- Question to add
	- How would they feel about themselves if they made the change?
	- What enjoyable new experiences would they have?
	- How would others perceive them now in a positive light? Connecting with this is powerful.
	- What words would they use to describe their dream outcome? Amplify this because you cannot add anything to their head, so you must understand them and work with what they already have.
#### Roadblocks
- Questions to add
	- What’s keeping them from making their dream state today?
	- What mistakes are they making that are keeping them from getting what they want in their life?
	- What part of the obstacle does the avatar not understand or know about?
	- What is the one key roadblock that was fixed will allow them to move forward toward their dream outcome?
- Pay attention to what they are not talking about
- This takes some time with advanced critical thinking and problem solving
- If you can’t reveal the key issue you will not be able to position your writing
- You need to be as detailed, accurate, and clear as possible without it you are and will fail
#### Solution 
- Questions to add
	- What does the avatar need to do to overcome the key roadblock?
	- “If they `insert solution`, then they will be able to `insert dream outcome`“
- They (the reader) usually have no idea what this (the solution) is
- Once this is crystal clear move on

#### Product
- Questions to add
	- How does the product to help the avatar implement this solution?
	- How does the product to help the reader increase the chances of success?
	- How does the product help the reader get the results faster?
	- How does the product help the reader get the results with less effort or sacrifice?
	- What makes the product fun?
	- What does your target market like about related products? Go out and find products that solve a similar problem to learn about them
- You need to understand how the avatar implements the solution, this is where you position the product to be fast, easy, etc FOR THEM
- The avatar may know what they need to do but don’t have the tool to accomplish the task
- Research existing solutions and learn what the avatar hates about them and then use that info in your copy to flip them
#### Research Sources
1. Clients and their customers, just ask them, with their online testimonials, etc. The client most likely has all of this information about their customers cause they’ve been dealing with them.
2. Social media watch their YouTube videos, read their comments, look for any oversharing, and any other online presence they have
3. Amazon.com reviews look for books addressing a similar roadblock to yours with the five stars which tell you all the good and read the one stars which tells you all the bad
4. Reddit look for community subreddits and collect their language and their experiences it’s a great place to find the information about how people feel and what has worked well (and a lot) in the past
5. **Quora:** Find the questions and answers surrounding the problem your product solves
6. **Google:** There’s just a lot of information here, you’ll be surprised 

### Research Walkthrough
- Copy the read only document for your research template 
- For the example we are using Amy who is 100lb over weight
- Look for where people are having discussion and oversharing are gold mines
- 1-Star reviews are greatly beneficial as it outlines features and experiences that people don't want or enjoy
- As you go through and process the information notice the common complaints, praises, and experiences
- People share everything online so what you need to change people's minds is all there for you on the internet, especially in Reddit
- Facebook groups are good place to search along with Quora.
- Even if you can't spell you can still write just use autocorrect 
- Quora is a good place to find more information about the product and solution
- The process is to copy and paste and then highlight everything that has the highest emotional impact
#### Current State
- What content would soccer moms with this problem look for on YouTube and head to the comments for overshares, but also listen to the video
- Look for internal dialogues and just copy past their words
- Take note of the if, what, and how much emojis they use while you mine for information
- In Amazon look for Weight Loss for Women, this is great for informational products.

## Assignments
For this assignment you will use the research methods you learned in the videos to answer as many questions as possible inside the Research Document Template that you created for your Avatar in the last Homework.  

(Make sure you use the Research Document Template for the [Avatar](hu-copywriting-day-02-homework.md) you created when you analyzed this Sales Page in your previous assignment.)  

Template - [https://docs.google.com/document/d/1acFTpWhosOBwq2FYXVOUvZgkpSYfwoRAgB6JpQeQrUc/edit?usp=sharing](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1acFTpWhosOBwq2FYXVOUvZgkpSYfwoRAgB6JpQeQrUc/edit?usp=sharing))

You will need to make a copy of the Research Document Template and find as many answers as you can online about your avatar.  

You don't need to answer all of the questions but you should collect as much information as possible during a few Deep Work Sessions.

### Example
Here is an example of what the completed mission should roughly look like.

There is not one right or wrong way to complete the mission, this is just an example for you to measure your work against as you progress through the Bootcamp.
