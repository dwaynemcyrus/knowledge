It is morning time and Allah woke me for Fajr…I struggled to get up. But… Alhamdulillah my sleep and wake is beginning to return to normal which is a very happy experience for me to acknowledge. 
I would like, no. I am to conquer the day. 
This is good. 
I will live the day as I am supposed to.
So where are we going to start? I figure the simplest place is with connecting Talha and defining the objectives for the quarter. 
Great!
