Ya Allah I have hit a point of depression because I have not kept my word to myself. I said I would launch the art store this weekend and I did not. I didn’t even complete the photographing of the artwork so that they can be seen. 

Why is it that I have become so damn incompetent. I complete nothing that I start, absolutely NOTHING! 

What is wrong with me?!

I just finished my shower and I have come to recognize my thinking and mindset is still far too small!
I desire power, influence, and wealth.

Specifically in the African American, Muslim, art community, and men as a group. 

I need a plan for this. 

I also have the greatest weapon to acquire said power, speech and the pen. 😎
