So I just spent a significant amount of time going back and forth with people, specifically Muslim who carry racist views about Afro people. This hurt me deeply to have to discuss and partake in. To know that no matter where I go around the world if my hair texture is not like there’s, I am to expect discrimination. Even amongst Somalis that have a derogatory term for people like myself, Jareer. 

I hope I got the spelling correct. 


My heart hurts and it has really opened my eyes to how little a non-afro haired person will understand our experiences. 

“[[Hair of Wool]]” needs to be one of my next books to write.

There’s a great part of me that knows a wife who doesn’t strive vigilantly to understand this experience cannot Be with me. In addition. To this thought I am also wondering if there’s any beneficial logic to marrying out as it pertains to the racism my children will face.

Okay, do I best make use of the knowledge that I gained from my creator meeting with [[Khalvin Herbert|Khal]]?

You start! 


Yes, I know to start. The question is where?
