Istikarah 
Allah is making my art store under A Muslim Artist okay, if not can you inspire me with a new name very quickly.
Came to mind in prayer 
- dubhan 
- Tooffee arts
- Talha ???
44:20 — Submit yourself to Allah and be in that embrace. Keping the current name will keep you in remembrance of Allah — SWT in your art career.
48:9 Keep yourself in worship of Allah, remember you are being given guidance like the Prophet so follow suit.
46:9 — You are a messenger and your artwork is meant to be an extension of your message to others.
82:8 — Allah has willed this for you, hence the origins of the name take the form and work it.
34:1 — Be grateful to Allah that you are able to do this, and that Allah has provided you with the runway to act. Do not be ungrateful be attempting to start over.
