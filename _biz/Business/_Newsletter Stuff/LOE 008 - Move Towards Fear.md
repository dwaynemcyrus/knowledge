Fear directs us, and we run from the feeling.

The answers you seek reveal themselves to you through fear and anger.

Every time you are afraid to act in your own best interest is a sign telling you where you must go.

Fear is healthy.

Fear is normal.

Fear is our guide.

Walk in the direction of your fears.

You **DO NOT** need permission.

Move towards your desires.

On the other side of fear lies many of your answers.

Sincerely,  
*Dwayne Cyrus*
