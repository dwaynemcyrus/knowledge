- We live in the age of information 
- Everything is information that we use, everything! 
- Everyone has the same goal in life, to life a fulfilling life on their terms to feel good, a higher quality of life
- People hate what they do not understand 
- We are going to talk about digital products
- There are two pathways of education formal (do what others want), and the creator economy (do your own thing)
- A system to package your $100,000 idea(s) in your head
- Information allows one to build their own thing
- Your first product is going to suck! Naval said it is not 10,000 hours it is 10,000 iterations
![[quote - brand is what you do.jpeg]]

![[diagram - self-actualize and self-monetization.jpeg]]
- It’s all about productizing yourself, writing to yourself, selling to yourself, monetizing you! 
- Starving artists make what they think is valuable, not what they know! 
- If it’s not getting results, it’s not valuable, time to iterate
## Steps to making an information product:
1. Become above average in select skills and interests, if you are not making money or getting results you have a skill problem
2. Build something with those skills every single day. The more you build, the more you learn, 
3. Document your learning, findings, and results, use social media as a note taking tool your own diary 
4. Experiment for wholistic understanding, your way is pulling from others and making it your own, you like doing things your own way. The future belongs to those who can delivery wholistic and nuisance information to others, this is the synthesizer
5. Technology has allowed humans to be infinitely creative. Wrote your own SOPs for your life as a man, your own systems and the areas
6. Sell what are already selling successfully, steal from them, the structures and the why
7. Build distribution (content) and systemize the promotions (marketing). Say it, validate it, and then say it in 1000 different ways
