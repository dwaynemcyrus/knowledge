## Summary

***
## What is Copywriting?
Copywriting is using words to get people to buy things on mass, especially online. 
- Architects of persuasion, emotions, etc
- This is a core skill for success online

This skill allows for the following opportunities 
- Helping existing businesses make more money
- Launching your own business 
- Selling your own products online

This is about active income NOT passive income, you need to work and produce results for people to sell. 

## Copywriting Campus Core Values
These are the keys to rapid success. Students **must** live by these values: 
- Mindset
- Mental models
- Perspectives 

1. You pay the price for what you want
	- Watching Netflix is little value
	- You will pay with time, energy, money, or a mixture of both
	- *You don’t get things, you earn them*
	- The more valuable it is, the bigger the price you need to pay 
2. Be a professional, be a G
	- Hold yourself to a higher standard you are competing globally
	- Rise to the occasion 
	- Outwork your self doubt
	- Become competent
	- At some point next week you will be telling a client what you will do for them, you’ll need to rise to the occasion 
	- Take responsibility for the tiny actions in your life
	- Respect is core, there is a zero-tolerance for this 
	- The man who treats others with respect, gains respect himself
3. Top G Work Ethic
	- *When I’m awake, I am working* - Andrew
	- Understand "opportunity cost"
	- *Show me how you spend your time and I’ll tell you what your bank account is going to look like in 3 month* - Teacher
4. OODA Loop
	1. Bias toward action
	2. Make a hypothesis, take action, measure results, refine hypothesis, take action again, repeat until ultimate victory. Everything in this course and in your life works in this manner.
	3. Diagram example... ![OODA Loop Diagram](ooda-loop-diagram.jpg)

These values are the fundamentals to your success here in the campus.

## How to Accelerate you Ability to Learn and Work
- Copywriting is your ability to think persuasively and this ability is a muscle
- You need to train your body and brain to the point of failure 
- In most cases when you reach the failure point (the bleeding is edge) we reach for our phones and you need to practice pushing yourself beyond this to expand your creative thinking
- Binaural beats can offer focus when working, it may also just be a placebo effect, here's [an example](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mg7netw1JuM).

Steps to Deep Work:
- This is to be achieved by doing [[deep work]], you must be setup to be completely emersed in what you are doing. Keeping your phone completely out of sight is key. 
- Set a timer for 15-20 minutes after the first 10 or so you will enter flow where you can generate meaningful work
- You should be able to hit 90-120 minutes after training this week after this hits diminishing returns at that point you need to rest by doing something different like play guitar, go for a walk, read, etc.

Tips
- Drink 2 gallons of water a day to keep your brain functioning 
- Get your blood pumping during your breaks, the more O2 the better for your body
- Deep Work is a superpower this where you will be able to out perform others

Notes to self
- You have a built in Deep Work ability, this is a natural state for you 
- Read the book [[deep-work-by-cal-newport|Deep Work]] to learn more about this, so you can fine tune yourself 

## How to Ask Questions
But ONLY if you want Answers

- There’s a specific way to ask questions 
- We have been trained to place critical thinking on others, don’t do this
- Search for your answers before you seek out the answers in others
- Your ability to solve high level problems produces high levels of reward
- There’s no skill you cannot acquire if you teach yourself how to learn

Process of Asking Questions:
- Context of the problem
- What have you done to solve
- Share what you understand to be the best answer

### Do More Push-ups 
- This will help you progress, for some reason those who do the most learn and gain the most
- Those who train their mind benefit their body and those who train their body benefit their mind 
- Hit 100 push-ups a day at minimum
- This exercise also impacts how you deal with clients and others you are more confident and assertive 
- Teacher doesn’t know why this (the pushups) is effective, but it just is.

## Assignments
You are going to be practicing your Deep Work Skills.  
  
Start your first Deep Work Session and spend it reading this sales page:  
[https://drive.google.com/file/d/1q8Y1PKpvrA985L3KE5RosykNn6_gv7Uu/view?usp=sharing](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1q8Y1PKpvrA985L3KE5RosykNn6_gv7Uu/view?usp=sharing)   
  
During your Deep Work session try and figure out how the author of the sales page is trying to influence the reader.
  
Take notes as you read.  
  
There is no right or wrong answer.  
  
The main point of this homework however is for you to practice your focus during a Deep Work Session
