## Experiences & Gratitude
Below are the categories of things to consider gratitude for. Think along the lines of what you have done. Take some time to celebrate the big & small wins. If needed, look through your camera roll and journal for the year.

List the top 3-6 in the following categories.
##### I am thankful for...
- All the people who have contributed and supported me in now having a family of my own and making Hijra to get married Islamically and legally in Switzerland.
- Visiting London, Turkey, Spain, Germany, France, Switzerland, and Romania. I got to be in different places and experiences surviving with nothing, just a backpack really for a few of these spaces. I survived even though it was very difficult emotionally, mentally, and physically especially in Turkey.
- I have a daughter on the way! Imaani Inayah Cyrus. It's unbelievable to me, still has not set it that it is real.
- Through all of the chaos and hurt from Souen, really painful and scaring stuff. Things I believe are not acceptable at all and was extremely risking being around — I stuck it out and it seems to have passed, though I will never forget. Can't.
- For my little desk in the corner, it is starting to feel like I have my own space in the house now. Though I only set this up last night, hopefully it is the start of me having my own space and really running this place in order.
##### I am proud of...
- Holding on to Allah and the way of righteousness, even after going through the influences of Souen's thoughts. I held firm and am holding tighter, this family stuff is tough as it needs me to be BIG.
- Leaving everything I know and taking a risk in life, moving to a new country, and just following the path that Allah Allah SWT set forward for me. I told Allah Allah SWT I wanted to live a wealthier place that's much safer, and here I am in Basel, Switzerland.
- Being a great husband and dad to two kids that come from two different dads and sorting through the drama that comes with that from Souen, and the men, and the impact those and other male relationships have had on these three.
##### I overcame...
- Doubts in my own decision as a Muslim, questioning if I should be more "spiritual" like the Afro-Americans from Souen's own confusions about being Muslimah.
- Backpacking around a few countries with nothing to my name.
##### People to acknowledge...
- Khal: This man literally got me through so much of my life and me having a family and making Hijrah I miss him!
- Uncle Mike: Being a good examples and also helping make Hijrah.
- Damian: For getting me thinking about myself and learning of my connative, but more importantly getting me to think about being an artist and being a positive influence to leaving the country to get married.
- Aunty Dorothy: For giving me the signs from Allah Allah SWT, whats left now is the remainder of what she told me — the stuff for me that's been deep in my hear, financial sovereignty and expression as an artist.
- Aunty from TikTok: She helped me get to the next steps for my Hijrah.
- Charles: This guy has always been there for me since I have known him, my hammer. He got me into the men's group and connected me with good brothers.
- Guru from TikTok: Helping me make it through the homelessness out in the world as I jumped around.
- Toto Chen: Paying for the marriage fee that we needed to do in an emergency here in Switzerland.
##### Experiences of the world...
- Been to 7 different countries 
- Taking on a pre-made family of a woman with an illness and two kids of two different dads, to becoming a husband and dad simultaneously
- Learning what it is to really depend on people, brothers, Souen's brothers to be exact
- Not much, but little by little getting the hang of Swiss culture
##### Experiences of success...
- Being a dad of two
- Returning to my Salat
- Being a husband
- Fighting to hold on to my Islam
- Almost completing the Qur'an in full in reverse (as of this writing)
- Implementing foundational structures (infrastructure) into Souen's and the kids life
- Having a phone number that is mine and it is Swiss from the top provider Swisscom
##### Experiences of failure...
- Remaining in a state of doubt about my abilities to step forward with the work that Allah SWT has given me clearly
- Not maintaining my practice as a Muslim
- Keeping out of communication with the people that I care about
- No money coming in
- No art being made
- No speaking to the people
- Not taking care of myself
##### Life changing experiences...
- Fathering my own child, she'll be out in 5-7 weeks, Alhamdulillah
- Living in Switzerland and needing to learn the language, learn the rules, and cultural norms
##### Purchases of joy...
- None, and that makes me sad.
## Lessons & Discoveries
##### Learned about myself...
- Allah SWT really has my life mapped out for me and it is good, the problem is I need to see myself as worthy of such greatness.
- My resilience and patience is top notch, in all ways it is amazing.
- I can really make and shape life as I want it as long as i commit and put in the work consistently.
##### Learned about others...
- When you ask you do receive
- Abused people abuse others
##### Impactful discoveries...
###### People: 
- n/a
###### Books:
- [[The Way of Kings by Brandon Sanderson]]: It's a masterpiece is sharing the world I am experiencing especially as an audiobook. 
###### Games:
- [[Warcraft Rumble]]: It's a really fun quick entry and exit mobile game, would be nice to make something like this and a mobile version of [[Patapon]].
###### Places:
- Antalyia, Turkey: Where I spent 3 months in a very dark space not doing well physically, mentally, emotionally, and spritually.
- ???, Spain: Family trip with the kids of Souen and ToTo Ray. Great for the kids, emotionally rough and painful for me.
- ???, France: We made a stop here on our road-trip to Spain and had pizza, it was cool.
- ???, Romania: The first and original escape destination to wait out for marriage, but it then become apart of the EU. The place itself was really nice, good people, awesome mall, and great pricing. Sweet memories with ToTo Jo.
###### TV Series 
- The Walking Dead: Great series, but the ending was such a horrible thing to do, truly! Left way too many strange holes with the main characters.
- Fear The Walking Dead: Very slow in the first half, but when they put Morgan into play, it got good until they took him out.
## Felt & Still Feel
How are you really? Remember, there’s no right or wrong way to feel — all feelings are valid. What feelings did I feel? Were there any reoccurring patterns?
- Confused and uncertain about who I am to be and what it takes to become, along with what am I even to become.
- Shame for having doubt in what Allah Allah SWT has given me to do, my path forward.
- Excitement for taking a risk and becoming a dad and husband in a new continent with an entire new way of living, language, culture, etc.
- Insecure and less of a man for not earning money this entire time. Not earning because I am hiding myself from Allah Allah SWT work for me. Questioning my worth and capabilities.
- Small and not in control a I been allowing my life to be dictated by the feelings of others and my own fears to making others uncomfortable.
- Lost because I am not creating and building. Making things that express e and help others.
#### Leaning into...
Did I allow myself to lean into these feelings? Why or why not?
Yes, I have leaned into these negative feelings for way too long because they are comfortable and familiar to me. No what needs to happen is that I do the opposite, the exact and extreme opposite in order to then find the balance needed.

I have not leaned into the excitement because there's a big part of me that does not feel worthy, nor allowed to be. My mom's voice and dad's, they have made my censor.
##### Which of these feelings would I like to let go of, and which would I like to take with you into the new year?
###### Let Go
- Lost
- Small
- Insecure
- Less of a man
- Shame
- Confusion
- Uncertainty
###### Bring Forward
- Excitement
###### Turning Them Around
This is about taking the negative feelings commonly grounded in shame and finding actions to turn them into pride. Refer to the list above where you described the feelings.
- Lost to Found: Embrace the work of Allah SWT with a plan, create art, speak to people, build useful things.
- Small to Big: Define and live by your own rules and that of Allah SWT only.
- Insecure to Secure: Become financially self-sufficient in order to take care of yourself as a man should.
- Less of a man to More of a man: Do and complete what you start, fight for your desires as a man, be the example.
- Shame to Pride: Be a [[Muslim]] in all things, own it, represent it, no more fear! You are [[Mujahideen]]. This is [[Jihad]]. Learn in-depth your way of life.
- Doubt to Conviction: Make yourself a man of absolute knowledge and trust in Allah SWT in all that you do, return to your daily [[Istikarah]]. 
- Confusion to Clarity: Remember who you are and decide what you are going to become, be clear and put it everywhere so you can see and read it. Write it out.
- Uncertainty to Certainty: Figure out how to build confidence. This i believe is by doing things, building competence in the knowledge as skills you need in order to become.
#### Held anger...
Who and what are you angry at? Who are you holding responsible?
- **Who: [[Dunbar Cyrus|Dad]]**
	- What: Not giving me the tools needed to be a self-sufficient man like him.
	- Holding: [[Dwayne M Cyrus|Myself]]
	- Direction: Train yourself into self-sufficiency.
- Who: [[Dwayne M Cyrus|Me]]
- What: Treating myself like I am not worthy of greatness despite all of my life's evidence that opposes this treatment.
- Holding: [[Dwayne M Cyrus|Myself]]
- Direction: Treat yourself like a man of greatness, [[The Benevolent Dictator]].
#### Limiting beliefs...
Limiting beliefs are thoughts, opinions that one believes to be the absolute truth. They tend to have a negative impact on one's life by stopping them from moving forward and growing on a personal and professional level.
- Making art is bad for you, because it was bad for you as a child as it lead to not nice memories.
- You are unworthy of being seen, so anything that makes you seen is dangerous and should not be done.
- No matter how good you make something it will never be enough, you mom taught you this, so why bother even making.
- Speaking up for what I need and want (boundaries) will make me a bad person which I learned from my mom's treatment of me. 
## Work To Be Done
