What’s your story? Where are you going? How are you getting there? Who are you? When will you get there? 

Guide people towards…

Guide people away from…

**The enemy that people are fighting…** conformity to the chaos of society and the emotional slavery that has been presented as the right path away from good orderly direction. To live defeated, self-sabotaging, and accepting of abuse — to be away righteousness (family and community) and to be consumed with hedonism. 

In short, weak men.

**The ideal life people are fighting for…** the freedom to decide — to be sovereign, to be righteous. To live by good orderly direction and for family and community to be the foundation of our lives on earth. 

In short, strong men.

How will you get them there…
- Private remote guidance in 1-1 and group settings.
- Insights shared through live conversations, pre-recorded content, and written social media posts.
- Public access to an online community, trainings, tools, and resources.
- Documenting my journey as the evidence and the example of what is possible.
- Artwork providing emotional inspiration and expressing emotional challenges.

In return for this money I will give the most sufficient service to which I am capable of rendering to the fullest possible quantity and the best possible quality of service in the capacity of group and 1-1 remote education on trauma recovery. I believe that I will have this money in my possession. My faith is so strong that I can now see this money before my eyes. I can touch it with my hands. It is now awaiting transfer to me at the time and in the proportion that I deliver the service I intend to render in return for it. I am awaiting a plan by which to accumulate this money and I will follow that plan when it is received.

### Point of View
For a better black society we need men to return to the family structure and the only way to get there is through the healing of men's trauma and the prioritization of our boys holistic education ([[The Language to Employ#Rights of Passage|Rights of Passage]]) into manhood.
#### Novel Unique Perspective
The average black man is responsible for all of our communities woes and are capable of fixing it by setting boundaries, healing trauma, and embracing holistic masculinity. Blaming women disempowers and removes us as the “leaders” of home and community. 
#### The Transformation
Healed, equipped, trained, and capable men focused on true legacy creation, family management, community development, and [[The Language to Employ#Mental Sovereignty|mental sovereignty]] grounded in high EQ – moving one from dating to courtship, self-destructive to productive, and suffering/surviving to thriving.
#### The Enemy
Mentally colonized men who have bought into the idea that women are to blame (RedPill, Closer to Whiteness, Colonizer Mentality, etc.) for anything and that our role on this planet is meaningless. At best we are just to be cheap labour and free wallets to fund chaos in the societies to which we live. The idea of [[Allah|The Great Creator]] is foolish and the universal laws are not to be follow, idolize oneself and bath in hedonism. Defending the bad and discouraging the good. To keep boys and in-turn men to be weak, feeble, depressed, drained, and hopeless so that the women and children we are to protect are left vulnerable to the evil and lost (weak) men among us, especially those is control of major systems, resources, and influences.
#### Differentiated Insight
The trauma of men creates and destroys the very fabric of society and ripples through the generations. This problem begins with the lack of emotional guidance and mental training that creates developmentally stunted men who have no connection to their natural role in society. Often leading them to lives of self-destruction chasing fleeting acceptance and “love”.
#### Rejecting the Premise
I **[[backcast]]** to educate and inspire men on the new and different way of being. They are imprisoned and comforted by their attendance to the various establishments of [[The Language to Employ#Emotional Strip Club|emotional strip clubs]] (Popular men's content such as the [[Manosphere]] and [[Redpill]]). [[Stockholm Syndrome]] has them locked up and it does not have to be this way. Locked into a cycle of fear and mistrust of their own capabilities and potential wrapped in a mind that has been colonized by the evil peoples of power. Worst of all placing the pain of men at the feet of women to solve.
#### The Enrolment
**Exposing others to the POV…**
- Get into conversations with larger voices that are different from or adjacent to your own through podcasts and live interviews.
- Provide public solutions and answers for the suffering and confusion caused by your POV’s enemy.

- Deeply empathize with people’s current state to show understanding while providing evidence based reasoning with facts, statistics, and credible sources.
- Model the behaviour yourself and share the stories of your own life’s experiences and how you have become better.

### Being of Service
#### Big Problem 
Summary: Lacking healthy emotional regulation to make meaningful connection with self and others.

**The Struggle of Survivors to Transition from Surviving to Thriving After Trauma**

Survivors of trauma, especially those who have experienced childhood abuse and sexual abuse, often struggle with deeply ingrained issues such as low self-worth, emotional wounds, and destructive patterns. These challenges prevent them from fully healing and achieving their desired personal growth, healthy relationships, and a fulfilling life. Your focus is on guiding them through the process of deep emotional healing, building emotional intelligence, and developing healthy communication and relationship skills to move from merely surviving to truly thriving.

My work addresses the profound lack of integrated mental health support for trauma survivors, particularly men recovering from sexual abuse, who struggle to find healing that respects and incorporates their cultural and spiritual values. This gap hinders their ability to fulfill their roles as leaders within their families and communities. I empower individuals to overcome emotional trauma, navigate their personal development journeys, and build healthier, more fulfilling relationships, ultimately achieving personal empowerment and fostering authentic connections.

**Key Aspects of the Problem:**
1. [[private/Essays/Healing Emotional Wounds|Healing Emotional Wounds]]
2. [[private/Essays/Building Self-Worth and Confidence|Building Self-Worth and Confidence]]

4. [[private/Essays/Enhancing Emotional Intelligence|Enhancing Emotional Intelligence]]
5. [[private/Essays/Creating a Fulfilling Life Beyond Trauma|Creating a Fulfilling Life Beyond Trauma]]

As a thought leader, I am dedicated to empowering trauma survivors to heal deeply, build their self-worth, develop healthy relationships, and ultimately thrive in all aspects of their lives. My work addresses the comprehensive journey of moving from a state of survival to one of thriving, helping individuals to transform their lives and achieve lasting fulfillment.
#### Value Proposition
