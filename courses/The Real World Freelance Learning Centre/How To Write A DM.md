A DM (or Direct Message) is a message you will send to prospects (potential clients) on social media platforms or via email.  
  
It’s a SUPER simple element of freelancing, let’s not overcomplicate this. The POINT of this message is to offer your service and close them on said service, or my preferred method is getting on a sales call with the prospect to determine if they’re a good fit.

## What Should DMs to Potential Clients Look Like
When it comes to DM’s, you must try out different styles. One of the worst things you can do is: USE THE SAME STYLE AS EVERYONE ELSE. (SUPER IMPORTANT!!!!!!!)  
  
So instead of telling you word for word what to say, I will give you a framework. First though, let me make something clear. Stop talking so much about yourself, you’re here to help THEM! Make it clear.

**Example:** Don’t tell them about how you will write 5 tweets a day, tell them how you will make them more money and increase their engagement.

## DM Styles
The basic premise of a DM: You want to make money. The prospect (potential client) wants to make MORE money, so he/she can give you some money.

### Style 01
A specific compliment  
  
Then end with a question (that sets them up for your service) Example for email copywriting offer:  
  
Hey Gabby, Your recent thread about [specific compliment referencing a recent post] stuck out to me because [insert].  
  
Are you currently repurposing your threads for your newsletter?

### Style 02
1. Custom line to catch their attention (DO NOT write something generic to “save time”).  
  
2. Problem or what you’ve done for other people (social proof)  
  
3. Give some BENEFITS (how you will help them specifically) of how you’d help, not features (I’ll write 3 emails a week blah blah).  
  
4. CTA leading them to a call In this style you’re pitching the service with a call to action at the end… so they get on a call for you to see if they’re a good fit to work with.

### Style 03
For prospects you have built rapport with, you want to make a strong impression and you LOOK trustworthy/speak the language of the person you’re reaching out to….  
  
Create a short video explaining how you came across the prospects profile, how you can help them, and offer to get on a call with them to explain in more detail the ideas you have to help them.  
  
Yes this could be a bit more energy/effort so do this when you think they’re a strong prospect.

### Style 04
Hey, xyz [specific compliment] Say you’re new to what you’re doing but confident you do great work. Then offer to work with them in exchange for a testimonial.  
  
You’ll need to work with them for a bit of time, not just ONE VIDEO or something super tiny. You need to demonstrate REAL VALUE for them, aka overdeliver so that they can vouch for your work.  
  
You then use this testimonial in your social media posts, story, reels, twitter threads, in DMs to new prospects, on your website, on your linktree, etc.

### Style 05
This style works when you have GREAT social proof, a well-built profile, lots of followers, etc. on your account…. Be casual. Hey, xyz your post about xyz caught my eye because xyz. That reminds me of a previous client where I helped them go from [insert figure like $4k to $50k] per month.]  
  
Your persona makes me think I can help you do the same. I’m headed to the gym now [or insert other activity], but I’m free early tomorrow to jump on a call to discuss this more.  
  
Just let me know! attach proof of your claim

### Style 06
ONE LINE QUESTION  
  
You noticed something about their profile or liked something they said? Ask a question. It will open them to a reply - it’s SHORT so they aren’t having to read your paragraph DM Then set them up for your pitch/offer/call etc. Remember:  
  
You don’t have to pitch them your whole service in the first DM. You do have to make this about them, though.

### Style 07
This method is for those who are experienced with their skill... It’s also best for prospects who you have built rapport with and you’d really like to worth with them.  
  
You will choose one of the other DM styles (ideally keeping it brief) Then create a LOOM video recording of you critiquing something of theirs. Example: a Loom recording of you commenting on their IG profile (if you manage IG pages) and letting them know what you would do differently.  
  
Or for someone that has a website, a recording of you commenting on their site. This should only be 2-3 minutes long.

## Follow-Up
Should You FOLLOW UP? (Assuming they didn’t reply) Yes, yes you should follow up. Follow up 2-3 days later with a short message… Or follow up with a relevant MEME.  
  
Yes, this works. You can also follow up on ANOTHER platform. If you DMed on Twitter with no response, try their IG a few days later letting them you DMed them on Twitter and [this is] what you said -   USE UR BRAIN AND SPELL UR WORDS PROPPERLLEEE (properly) How are you going to offer email copywriting services when you can’t even grammar a short DM correctly?

## What Now?
1. REWRITE and READ over your DM again. You DO NOT want to send out a “rough draft.” You should read over your message multiple times before sending it out.  
  
2. Then send out your DM in batches of 10 per day (10 per social media platform to avoid problems)  
  
3. Once you have sent your DM 20 times (this should take you 2 days) then…  
  
4. Place your DM in ⭐︱DM review to have it reviewed by successful freelancers (BE SURE TO FOLLOW THE PINNED MESSAGE IN THAT CHANNEL OR YOU WON’T GET A REPLY!)  
  
5. Keep testing your DM and change it based off of the responses  
  
6. Come back to get more feedback if you feel you need it  
  
7. You’ll keep sending DMs until you have your desired amount of clients If you did choose to have them get schedule a call with you…
