## The Script
"Carrying the weight of shame, guilt, and the shadows of suicidal thoughts and isolation – I’ve lived through it all. As a survivor of sexual abuse from childhood into adulthood, I understand the heavy burden these experiences bring.

My name is Talha Cyrus, and my journey has taken me from enduring trauma to building resilience and clarity. Now, I am not just surviving; I am well on my way to thriving. My mission is to guide 80 million men towards not just overcoming their struggles but transforming them into a life of empowerment and growth – for themselves and their families.

With the support and guidance from the UGC campus, I am eager to embark on the Gold Pathway. Together, we can create a world where resilience, clarity, and purposeful living are within every man’s reach. Thank you for considering my application, and I look forward to the opportunity to contribute and grow with the UGC community."
