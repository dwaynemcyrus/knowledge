By using the NVC Self-Check, you can transform conflicts into opportunities for deeper understanding and connection.

	- Two things you can smell

1. **Deep Breathing**: Take slow, deep breaths to center yourself. You can make use of the Box Breathing.
2. **Positive Affirmations**: Silently repeat (under you breath, not in your head) affirmations like, "I am calm" or "I am in control."

**Benefits**:
- Immediate grounding and reduction of anxiety

### The Ladder of Inference

During personal conflicts, the Nonviolent Communication (NVC) Self-Check encourages stepping through each rung of the ladder:

- **Selecting data**: Choosing what details to focus on in the conflict.
- **Adding meaning**: Interpreting actions based on personal beliefs and experiences.
- **Making assumptions**: Forming conclusions about intentions or motives.

### The Circle of Influence and Control
Managing Emotions with Strangers (Grounding Exercise)

The Circle of Influence and Control helps you focus on what you can change or influence, crucial for managing anxiety and presence in social settings.

In social gatherings, the Grounding Exercise centers on focusing on what's within your control and influence:
- **Inside the Circle (Control)**: Practicing deep breathing and affirmations to stay calm and grounded.
- **Outside the Circle (Influence)**: Using positive body language and active listening to influence interactions positively.
- **Beyond the Circle (No Control)**: Letting go of worries about others' perceptions or external factors.

The Circle of Influence and Control can help you manage anxiety in social situations by directing their attention to what they can control (e.g., your reactions and mindset), enhancing the effectiveness of the Grounding Exercise.
