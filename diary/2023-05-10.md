We are going to attempt this again! 
Today I am a sayer. What I declare will be done gets done. 
Let’s go Talha!

It took forever, but I created my website and allowed for it to exist so that others may see it.
I am very proud of you man!

I finally got the website up. My initial upload had an error accessing the resources for the CSS and JS. It took my a long time to troubleshoot and fix, I got it done.
So now I’m here thinking what next? 
There many options, it’s just a matter of what will get me to money the fastest ya know. Well…updated your portfolio and resume as a designer/marketer/strategist will be a good idea. Trust in Allah SWT, you made the Istikarah now act on all three okay!
