Istikarah 
Taking content creation as a digital writer as my ways of earning money to support my work as a wounded healer and my self and family with Souen Insha’Allah (I didn’t make Istikarah on this yet).

Open
41:52 Believe in the signs and the ways of Allah the Quran was written, Nadeem said you have the power of the pen as a sign. Now listen to Allah! 

First
15:47 Hmm… something about my heart and resentment being removed…help me understand Allah 
46-48 This is talk about Jannah, this is a good sign! 

Second
111:2 All I can receive is to be mindful of the focus on wealth, that is from Allah 
Surah I need to learn more about this story it has come up often…the message is needed

Third
74:36 Use this writing as a warning to others, be who Allah revealed in a recent Istikarah, you are a messenger! 

Close
40:31 Be a man of justice but I am not familiar with their stories here
