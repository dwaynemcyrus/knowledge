## Mission
1. The ideal target market is for writers in the creative fields and by extensions creative professionals of various industries and mediums.
2. The Avatar: 
	- Andy Kovurus
	- They been a writer all their life with big ideas and poor execution. He’s had various forms of success in his industry but nothing of consistency. Works alone as a freelancer so the pressure to produce is always high. Constantly in search of ways to break the barrier to his creative flow, having tried everything from workshops to various natural and medical remedies. Often he depends of coffee to barrel through his deadlines with ridiculously long unproductive hours of work and creative block. 
	- His days are the same in bed late up just in time to get ready for his day to start usually around 10/11am. He starts off slow expecting another uphill battle, shuffles straight to the coffee to pick himself up before he showers and dresses. Checks his emails and connects with editor, then heads to his local coffee shop to start his writing efforts. Often with a bit more hope that quickly 
	- 
	- fades after the first 30 minutes. A professional so he always hits the deadlines, but the journey is never enjoyable, he’s unfulfilled and wants more creative flow. His days end late at not often spent alone outside of the many 
	- 
	-interactions with co-workers and friends to distract him on his phone.
	- He believes in productivity and being healthy, though his life isn’t a good representation of it. Values science and logic, along with being efficient to make more time for a social life. Always on the hunt for inspiration and creative output. 
	- Despises wasting time, having to depend on coffee to gain access to his creativity. Anything illogical or grounded in mysticism.
	- His colleagues and close group of writer friends online hold a heavy influence of his decisions. His editor and the people he works for influences what he has access to creatively because he is still stuck within himself. Thinking he can’t move forward some of his own creative seeds. 
	- Pains are creative access, focus, and motivation to write his own works. Frustrated with his lack of productivity in his own endeavours, all of his ideas dying on the branch never blossoming. 
	- Desires consistent access to a state of flow and efficiency in production so that he has more resources to pursuit his own projects. 
	- Key roadblock is his lack of focus to create their own works.
	- Solution is if you become more focused with your work it will give you access to doing your own personal projects
	- The product provides an increase in mental performance through energy, motivation, memory, and focus which will increase his productivity as a creative individual.
