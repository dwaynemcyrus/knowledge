Today we will reset our life and mental and environment, today I will commit to me!

We are going to pray Fajr and then meditate for 10 minutes and seek guidance from All and to calm my mind. Once that is over we will do a few pushups and begin the GTD process to completion. That is our focus.

Today I clean house and reset.

Today we fast no social media, no consumption just Qur’an, the wife, and clarity of mind.
