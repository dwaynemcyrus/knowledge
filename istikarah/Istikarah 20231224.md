Is joining Dan Koes paid community for guidance in becoming a one person business as a content career what I should invest in?  

65:6 We have had this Ayat before Ya Rabb, what does this mean it seems very middle ground. I am pregnant with the idea so does this mean I should make the investment if I’m going to do the work feeding it? Or is it that I already have what I need to feed the idea and that I must divorce from needing others?
1-10 need more clarity but I will say Allah is the most merciful Subhan’Allah. Give me more clarity ya Rabb because is just letting me know I can make the decision and that there’s consequences and requirements of committing to it

First
5:94 Okay, so yes…me wanting to become this messenger and build a business to help other and care for my family remotely has been a test. So what do I do Allah SWT? Is Dan Koe community a good resource for me? 
91-97 I get it I think…this is part of the test…we will be tested with what we are desiring that we can attain. So being a content creator is attainable for me Alhamdulillah. Thought I still need guidance in paying for access to this group. Why do you need though Cyrus? 

Second
66:5 Divorce yourself from needing other to get the work done. Hmmm…who did Allah provide you with? Nadeem a Muslim who has knowledge of this works already. Why go for another when you have him? Damn.
1-9 Okay…stick with the Muslims. There’s more in this I just know it went over my head I feel it

Third
78:6 I do not understand at all.
1-11 Allah is your provider turn back to Allah through Nadeem. 

Close
11:5 Stop trying to hide from Allah and what his  has and is giving you! 
1-11 be great full and do good deeds…this work is good allow Allah SWT to guide and provide for you stop trying to provide for yourself simply so the work! Gratitude is the answer! 

Conclusion
Decide and make a decision about doing the work this also come toward the Nightinggale speech decide on a worthy goal for the next 30 days and go after it with everything you got. Do not focus on money focus on value of service.
