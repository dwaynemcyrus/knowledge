## Summary



## Notes
### Strategic Expectation management
- This is a new area of the program and it's important that you do the activities even without an actual client
- The next 4 stages are going to be tedious, boring, and slow, this is where the work to getting your first client begins
- After these next 4 days you will be into your Legion where you will have you team to work with toward your first client
### The Hunting Mindset
- With your sub niches identified you need to now install the Hunting Mindset
- Step One Understand your target/preys daily habits, locations, what they like and what the do in order to plan your hunt
- Basically you need to understand what your target does, what they do, what their activities are and reverse engineer them to find them at specific activities to make the shot 
- The reverse engineering is what platforms are they on, their daily digital schedule, when is it that they get online, then how do I identify these to add to my hunting database
- The two things they will do is make content for their customers and make accounts to be identified by their customers 
- You want to identify the search terms that will pull up their content as a tool to use

### Setting Up Your Spreadsheet
- This is all about collecting information on your prospects so you can reach out to them 
- Remember you want them to have a high margin product and a community
- Split your prospecting by the day to keep track of your work, this is very important

### How To Prospect On Youtube
- YouTube is the Teachers favourite tool to use as it provides the most information and is highly underrated as a search tool
- When searching you need to think more about the content that these high margin clients would create “how to do a planche for beginners”
- Sort by view count and you want to reach out to people within a particular size between 5k-500k anything more than that they probably already have systems in place
- Start by opening up each channels page and you want to look for if they have an audience, then digital products, if they don’t have a website page filter out
- The most important aspect of this prospecting has is filtering out people quickly
- Prospecting is a skill, so develop it
- Prospecting is learning how to filter out people, language, no audience, no products at margin, they seem shady
- When you find potentials you want to add them to your email swipe file
- It’s always best to reach out to the prospect by their name than their business name or nickname, a good way to find their name is by watching their video to see if they introduce it, some people prefer to work completely anonymous 
- Hunting for a name is not a common barrier, also be sure to check their comments section someone might mention it
- For the compliment field be sure to watch their most recent content (video) to make mention of when you reach out, the teacher will expand on this in the future
- Go through as many search terms as possible until you hit diminishing returns then move on to the next terms

### How To Prospect On Instagram
- Instagram is harder to search for content, so the key here is to search for profiles, think about what your prospect might say in there bio and profiles
- You are using the same metrics from the YouTube search in terms of followers, etc.
- Be mindful to look into the engagement of their posts as a metric
- Once you find one prospect on Instagram, click the button that gives you "related accounts"
- When the suggested bar stops giving worthy results, search for a new term and repeat

### How to Prospect on Facebook
- Best to search for pages only on FB, nothing else matters
- Make sure to use the "verified" filter to get the best accounts to show up first
- FB pages are good because they tend to give you all of the information that you already need in one place
- Again you are following the same metrics for evaluating
- Go to hunter.io and plug in the domain name when you can't find a more personal email address to use like "suport@domain.com"
- Always subscribe to the newsletters to increase your swipe file
- A brand that is not directly connected to a person makes getting the contact information a bit more challenging, this is where the tools like [Hunter](https://hunter.io) com into play
- Sometimes you can Google search the business name and the owners name may come up. You can also look through LinkedIn to find the contact as well.
- Rule of thumb don't use names like "Mr.Coach", this must be the last, absolute last option to name an individual

### How to Prospect on Twitter
- Twitter has industries that are not big on the platform like "online gymnastic coach"
- Content vs Profile search works well on the platform, begin with the profile and prioritize this as there a lot of chatter on the platform
- Be mindful of the "You might like" area of suggestions its a good tool

### How to Find Prospects on TikTok
- This is a dumpster fire and is not recommended, spend as little time possible here
- It's best to make use of searching by content
- If they are using Patreon or selling on Fiverr these are not high quality activities, skip these
- Always be sure to check out their website, and other social channels to qualify the potential prospect
- Signing up for their newsletter can potentially give you an email address to make use of
- Searching TikTok is similar to making use of YouTube

### How to Prospect Local Businesses on Yelp and Google Maps
- Local gives you advantage because of the physical distance
- Good businesses to search: Microblading, Chiropracters, 
- Franchisers are not the best to reach out to, as they must likely already have their systems in place
- Be mindful to search in your city and then branch out of your city

### Tips on Finding Email Addresses
- Places to check: Website contact page, hunter.io, Appollo, Facebook about page, YouTube about page, sometimes on their Instagram, signing up for their newsletter
- The YouTube about page email reveal has a limit of about 10, the way to get around it is to have multiple gmail accounts to use
- Which email to use is best to have the owner and/or personal address. If you can't find that make use of the more generic ones like "hi@...", "info@...", "support@...", etc.

### How to Prospect Much Faster
- If you have your niches and search terms listed in advance this increases your speed
- Learn to pass on prospects quickly have a system for this, not enough followers, not a good product
- Only reach out the prospects that can be a good potential fit only
- Search for the personal info, compliments, ideas, the personalized stuff, save that for later, the goal is to make the list first. What you are implementing here is "[[batching]]", completing the work that involves the same mindset
- Compete with yourself in terms of timing, "beat the clock". Get X amount of prospects in an hours, beat that in the next hour.
