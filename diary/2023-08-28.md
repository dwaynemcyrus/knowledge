Yesterday we basically planned out a wedding…
 In Egypt 
Literally…

1. Rent a flat for the price of a hotel for 1-3 nights
2. Small foreign to Egyptian Muslims ceremony at the Masjid
3. Feeding people (ceremony and locals) her cooked food at a rented flat and giving away food managed by someone else
4. Ditch the dinner together to start getting sessions, yes sex at home (roof and main)

She wants to be a master at oral
Has a Pinterest
