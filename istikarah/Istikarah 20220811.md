How do I be a better man Muslim man?

Open: 17:81 (77-84) Continue to offer your night prayer, embrace Islam and all of its teachings, follow the ways of the Prophet. Damn! So I need to study more intensely how and what the prophet did as a man! 

  

83:2 Gove in full everything that you owe but also give in full everything when you are giving , do not cheat others or yourself out anything. Remain truthful and honest in all things! 

  

98:3 Follow the laws of Allah point blank! Learn them, and learn them well straight out of the Qur’an. Increase your studies to increase you wealth and your knowledge so that you may know the laws of being a man! 

  

112:3. (1-4) What is begets mean and begotten but from this the take away is to learn of Allah and be sure you do not equate anything to him in worship or in fear ! This is it the fear, I fear the judgement of others so much so that I do not act in the way that Allah has told me. Shame, massive shame on me!
