What is an Email Lost Really?
- it’s about having direct access between you and your readers to build connection 
- To stand out it’s not just writing words, it’s writing to a person to provide value
- You need to actually care about people in order for it to work, this gets people to take action on what you have to offer
- It’s more about building the relationship over using hacks to pursuade people
- You always need to ask yourself, “will the reader get tangible value from this email?”
- Having an email list gives you direct access to the reader regardless of what happens to any social media platform 
## Best Platforms to Email your List From
- Don’t use Mailchimp as they have become very “woke”
- AWeber is very straightforward email and minimal in its options
- ConvertKit is great for setting up email sequences
- Klaviyo is best for ecom brands as it’s designed for e-com
- Recommendation: ConvertKit (1), Aweber (2)
## How To Put Together A Landing Page
- You can use ConvertKit to make the landing page or Cardd 
- A landing page is about giving as much value up front to have them signup, you want it to be something tangible
- Always think what do my readers find valuable, how can you transform their life
- Thank you pages are a way to upsell your readers
- Always find ways to hook people’s attention in order to lead them down the page, fascinations
- Thank you pages need to build upon what was already offered for free in the signup
- Bullet points are mini-headlines and headlines attract attention from readers how do you know Madelyn Pat
- Always make it easy for people to hit the purchase link by having the link throughout the copy
## How To Launch Your Lead Magnet & Email List
- When launching your email start with a give away across social media platforms, “For the next 24 hours you can get my guide I usually charge 39$ for totally free//To grab it join the newsletter with the link below.” Or you can say “ get my $39 brook for free… (use 3 bullets) to highlight what’s inside”
- Use scarcity and the fomo to grab people’s attention
- You can also use hypefury to run the DM campaigns on Twitter
- The more money you make a client the more they want to keep you around 
## How To Segment Your List
- The one reason to segment your list is to be able to make specific content for them
- Segment by the social media platform they came from, buy the ones who purchased something and what, segment by the lead magnet
- The real money is in speaking and selling to specific segments of the email list
- The more targeted your email the better the ROI
- In your sequences it’s best to to move completed readers to another sequence
How To Mistake Proof Your Email List
- Not proof reading your email makes you look like an amatuer
- Always preview your email 
- Always show up on time, don’t have mistakes in your email, these things make you a professional
- Always check that your emails will not land in spam or promo by sending to 3 email platforms you own
- Make use of Grammarly to check your email
Putting Together A Welcome Sequence
- Using the word “free” in your subject line has a high probability of being flagged by Google 
- In first two paragraphs of the welcome you want  to dictate who this is for, the type of person you want reading this
- The next paragraph is to let them know that you don’t mind if you don’t fit and leave, by setting the expectations and to let them know to unsubscribe
- Ending the email with the encouragement for them to reply with questions and thoughts in order to open up more good will with the readers this also gives you insight into what problems that have and how to help them
- Always place insights on painpoints into a Google Drive doc for your client
- As a copywriter you are here to improve their life! 
- Second email is great to use to share a personal story, and letting them know who you are, but also to delink the guide to ensure they get it
- Third day email is a best place to include social proof and to ask them about how the guide was and encouraging them to reply and message you
- Afterwards you can set up a rule to move a completed sequence into a new sequence that helps them with their current guide to eventually upsell them on the next item of the value ladder
- It’s not just about the words, it’s about thinking ahead to build more sequences to move people up the value ladder to make them a life long customer
