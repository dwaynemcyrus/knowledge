**Headline:** Welcome to Endurance, the Journey to Personal Sovereignty after the Trauma of Sexual Abuse.

**Subtitle:** Introducing a new newsletter for survivors on the voyage to personal sovereignty.

### Introduction
ENDURANCE is your reminder to keep going, to rest in movement, and to always get back up. Trauma hits many of us, some harder than most. It is never an excuse to not learn to live. It is not easy, it is not pleasurable, it is exhausting work to keep going, and it is worth it.

Your life depends on it.

### Expectation
Each week you will receive two emails from me, one long and one short, really short. Both filled with the best of me for your benefit. I want for you what I want for myself, and I desire to live as me with no shame, no guilt, no hiding, true personal sovereignty on my terms. 
- The long email (Saturday nights at 10pm) will consist of a new lesson or perspective shift I have gained from my past week of keeping myself on this voyage we call life. 
- The short email (Wednesday mornings at 10am) will consist of a brief reminder to keep you going with a few useful links to content I have made or found beneficial.

### Purpose 
"Why do this?"

Some of you may be wondering. The answer is simple, life is hard, survivors rarely speak often living dead inside, and I vow to no longer live silent. This will be my way of speaking life into my very being by speaking to you. 

There's on more reason for me doing this and it is extremely selfish. I want an audience to bear witness to my rise of greatness as a living example of what's possible as long as you can have patience in movement (Sabr for my fellow Muslims).

Join me, become a part of my tribe.
