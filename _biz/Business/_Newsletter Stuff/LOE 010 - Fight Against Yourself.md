It has been about 3 weeks now since I have begun this newsletter and let me tell you, it’s very uncomfortable.

As I exercise my voice as a man and survivor, the uncomfortable memories of the past show up in new ways. The fight to remain committed is daily.  

The struggle is real but temporary.

I seek to provide as much value to you all for my own benefit. The more I take on, the better I become.

So far, so good.

I say all this as a reflection on how far one can go when you learn that your greatest enemy and obstacle is you!

Here I am writing, sharing, and fighting my own mind. The very mind that does not want to share my struggle, and prefers that I shrink away and hide.

This can no longer be an option for you or me.

Whatever it is that you are being challenged with, know that the only way forward is through.

Sincerely,  
*Dwayne Cyrus*

**PS:** My Kolbe A Index assessment has been a tremendous help in my recent progress. Understanding my conative abilities is yielding a great return. Let me know if you would like more.

#### Personal Progress
- I have been failing myself. so I have decided to begin purging my life in all ways physically, digitally, and socially.
- Embracing my talent and skills as a speaker, writer, and artist has been terrifying. With that feeling, I am embracing the pursuit of these three skills to mastery.
- Ramadan being my 3rd, has been rough. Not the fasting of food, but the removal and implementation of habits.
#### House Updates
- Book Club: Due to Ramadan we will be extending the read time for [The Human Element by Brianna Wiest](https://amzn.to/42pYyeH) to April 23, 2023. If you have not purchased, please use the link, as I get a kickback.
- We have a dedicated [Discord server for the community](https://discord.gg/9hMwbk5x2D) that we are making use of to stay in touch throughout the week. Every day (in the morning-ish) I have been sharing a message of motivation, so feel free to join in and say, *“Hi”*.
