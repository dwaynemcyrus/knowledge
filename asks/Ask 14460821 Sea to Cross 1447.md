### The Direction
*"O Allah! I seek goodness from Your Knowledge and with Your Power (and Might) I seek strength, and I ask from You Your Great Blessings, because You have the Power and I do not have the power. You Know everything and I do not know, and You have knowledge of the unseen. Oh Allah! If in Your Knowledge this action…*

**committing myself to the works of your plans for me based on the [[Sea to Cross 1447]]**

*...is better for my religion and faith, for my life and end death, for here in this world and the hereafter then make it destined for me and make it easy for me and then add blessings baraka' in it, for me. O Allah! In Your Knowledge if this action is bad for me, bad for my religion and faith, for my life and end death, for here in this world and the hereafter then turn it away from me and turn me away from it and whatever is better for me, ordain destine that for me and then make me satisfied with it."*
### The Response
###### The Pilgrimage  
22:7 This could be a tell to get to work as your days are numbered and the work must be done. 
###### The Star
53:61 Not sure, but I do not believe that the term sporting is good. Ya Allah, tell me more please as I do not understand.
53:57-62 Stop turning away from the work. These has been with you for a few years now and when you hit hardship you stopped and looked for distractions. Return to your prostrating in all ways especially the work, SUBMIT YOURSELF TO THE WILL OF Allah SWT.
###### The Resurrection
75:32 This seems like you really want to drive the point home for me to stop being disobedient. Err…I’m sorry. 
75:30-34 Do not be arrogant in your work, be in submission like Salat. Perhaps you must look at the work as worship as well. Muslims must be productive for this life and the next.
### The Understanding
This is a journey for you and it is and has been designed to be a long one. Do not demean it by behaving as though it s not your life’s work from Allah SWT. This work is your star, your path, the only way forward — your worship.

No more running away.
