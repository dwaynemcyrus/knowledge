Good morning Mr.Cyrus are you going to be a man today? Yes.

Are you sure about that? Yes.

What does being a man look like? Me keeping my word.

So what do you need to keep you word about? A few things…Jelly interview payment, Stewart marketing support, myself! 

Okay, let’s get this done today alright. Today is a communications day and the last day we are going to cover up for my shame of hiding, got it. 

So far I made Tahajjud and that was nice to be a bit emotional with Allah SWT, it has been a while since I cried though. Not a good sign.
