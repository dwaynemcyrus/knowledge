## What is a UGC?

User-generated content (also known as UGC or consumer-generated content) is original, brand-specific content created by customers and published on social media or other channels

It’s pretty much another form of discrete advertising. 

The customer won't even know you’re getting paid.
## What is a UGC Creator?
A UGC creator is someone who creates sponsored content that appears authentic but is designed to showcase a specific business or product.

Simply, you’re using your skills to make the business more money and you get paid for that.
## Why will businesses want my UGCs?
People ultimately trust other people. (not the business owner, he’s biased toward his product)

So someone separate from the business will create more trust and credibility with customers.

Brands need to work harder than ever to establish themselves as trustworthy.

And with 93% of marketers agreeing that consumers trust content created by customers more than content created by brands, this signals that UGC is the perfect format for businesses to level up their trust score.
## How do UGCs make me money?
You get good at making videos, then you reach out to businesses, and then you make videos that make them a ton of money. 

BOOM!!! They get money, you get money, the customer gets their problem solved, everyone wins.
## How long will it take to make money off of UGCs?
Let me give you some advice. Don't focus on the money. 

Focus on improving your skills and helping businesses make money. 

That’s when you’ll start earning enough money to go buy whatever the **f__k** you want.
## Can I get rich off of making UGCs?
There are people genuinely making 10k+ p/month from being UGC Creators.
## Can I do the UGC campus and my main campus at the same time?
You can, but it is always advised to focus on one campus entirely. 

Creating content takes dedication and time.

Also, be sure to keep your eyes peeled for the Creator Hub which will be full of creativity hacks etc.
## How much time will it take to get good at UGCs?
Depending on how hard you work it can depend.

But someone starting from scratch who works on UGCs every day can get good in 30 days.
## Why don't businesses make their own UGCs?
A business owner is biased towards his own product.

So people won't trust him. (As much) But someone who isn't associated with the business can create massive amounts of trust and credibility.
## Can I make a business out of just making UGCs?
How big can you dream? 

**That's the limit.**
