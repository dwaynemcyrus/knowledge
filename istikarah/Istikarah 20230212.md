**Today Istikarah** 

  

Guide me in what my next steps are now that I have made it to New York and have shelter.

  

58:1 Is this is reference to just the past few days where there was a ton of Islamophobia in the house with my mother? // 1-5 It seems like there been given an okay to make separation from my mother ya know from the house. 

  

92:19 Do not give with expectations? I’m not sure on this Allah. Or are we referencing the kindness of Beki for housing me? // 17-21 So give of yourself for the sake of Allah, I have been wanting this Hijrah and it is important that I do it. This is it, I think. 

  

15:3 This could be a reinforcement to stay away from your previous house and to make life here as they are not Muslim. // 1-9 Stick to your beliefs my brother… be and live as a Muslim! 

  

61:3 Keep your word! Do what you say! You made the claims about being in New York and making it happen here, well here you are! Allah DOES NOT like the hypocrite and the liars. Don’t be that guy. // 1-5 Don’t be defiant to Allah, you asked for this and Allah has provided for you now trust that this is just the beginning as you are not self-sufficient as yet

  

61:5 This seems like a reinforcement of being like the messengers and accepting that you have shared in your household. // Surah You are of the ranks my guy, fight to stay and build a life here for the sake of Allah for self-sufficiency in caring for yourself and in tie for your mother and sister. 

  

  

Conclusion 

I am where I am supposed to be and it is just the beginning. I know need to fight with my very life to keep this going and make my life happen here.
