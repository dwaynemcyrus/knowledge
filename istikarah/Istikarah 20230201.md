Istikarah 

Is leaning into doing relationship and personal dev consulting good for me? 

  

OPEN: 32:4 Allah created everything and there’s something i am forgetting in this… // 1-7 Al has arranged all things, this would include my life so I’m guessing whatever good I am trying to do is in alignment with Allah and is already blessed? I just need to pay attention to the signs… I am being well received that’s a good sign

  

38:33 Return them to me… my first thought Wa that doing this is an opportunity to give dawah //30-38 this is about the provision Solomon asked for and Allah provided…you have asked to being able to work in such ways and to earn a good living remotely is this not it? Seriously, Allah please give me more clarity I know I’m in doubt. 

  

97:5 I’m not sure what you mean Allah // Surah … you have taken me to the chapter about Qadr which is fate… okay! 

  

37:172 so if I lean into this and trust in you I will be given victory? // 168 - 175 Is there a part of you also telling me to move yea… to leave those who don’t believe my family potentially a reminder of yesterdays Istikarah. I am asking you are giving so I need to take. 

  

Close: 7:54 well this is a clear reinforcement like a seal. The similar reminder of not the exact same of Allah created it all so this is nothing for Allah to give you! //53-54 Okay I will listen Inwill listen I will listen!
