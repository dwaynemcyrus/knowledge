- Techniques for prep can be a quick workout, shaking your body out, etc
- You state of mind is extremely important prior to speaking to the camera, you want to be socially activated
## Delivery, Comfort, and Momentum
- Eye contact is best not to have it dead on the camera, keeping that focus can become intimidating 
- Think about resting your eyes on the lens rather than looking at the lense
- When speaking you want to be open in your body language, always ensure your hands are visible in the camera it’s a great way to be seen as safe. 
- Biologically we don’t trust people who don’t sure there hands as a fear of the weapon
- If you are uncomfortable in the environment in which you are filming in, DO NOT film
- Much like other campuses your wins build momentum which encourages you to work harder, that remains true here
## The Four Key Attributes

- You want the hook, 3 points, and an outro 
- Your outro is meant to hold a call to action for the viewer
- Make your first video on The Real World
- Do not edit or add subtitles, it needs to be a raw video which will be used as a baseline for future reference
