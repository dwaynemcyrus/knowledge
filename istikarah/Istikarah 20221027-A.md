Istikarah 

Am I meant to continue this work as a public figure online with a brand?

Open 36:6 Well this is direct and straight to the point. 

54:13 Noah and the ark a Warner of the people 

40:18 okay the message is loud and clear do what you been doing warn them people

104:3 your wealth in attention and voice and thought and opportunity is not permanent so do not waste it by being slow. Move now and move quickly on this

Close 19:72 listen to your commands from Allah so that you may be saved and read the previous Istikarah as well for proper reminders
