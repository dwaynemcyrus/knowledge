A four part framework that can be used en any Oder,it can also be used to coach yourself


1. Presence: get them to realize right now is the moment of your life is changing. We often get for to stuck in and we the past it en the effect future. Holding on to hew to the past failures a challenges occurred. Be presence Es the solution the key is to get the lent to let the past the future and of to enjoy the present and what is possible in the new now. Now you need to use yourself as a coach how can you get your clients to into the  present with you. "The name we lean into the possibility of now the more we can be fearless the first piece is to get the client into the new and to enjoy the moments and experience of those moments in the now.

O organize your mind: we are always thinking and creating narratives always judging thinking and reflecting 'it is ou minds way of protecting itself
And making sense of the world around us. Often when mend one is state it in this doesn't have the space to decide what is must beneficial far us and most empowering for us.

How the mind works….consume then get triggers by how one speaks then has an emotional reaction:
The negative - on this guy he thinks he knows everything
The positive - on this guy he knows something

Whichever experience/circumstance we experience we have is a chance that we make. Its a thinking chance that we Nate make, how we think about it makes the emotion in other words how we organize our mind creates the emotion. The person speaking and giving the presentation is a matter of fact, so if we can help the client look at the same matter of event /circumstance in a different thinking pattern we can change their perception and in turn have the potential to change the outcomes they have in their lives. How is it that I can work with my clients different thinking patterns? How if they are in a heightened emotional state can I get them down to a place where they can rationally discuss their thinking and choose a better thinking pattern. When we are in a spiral it’s hard because we believe what we believe to be true. And that means we cannot discuss. When you are mad you are mad. Our minds have many thinking patterns and we always choose the one that is most obvious and easiest because that is how we have always chosen the thinking. 
When we question why every time I watch YouTube I get mad, we can reflect and ask why in order to create the opportunity of a new thinking pattern. The goal is to clients to take a step back and reflect on all possible thinking patterns. Which will can completely change behaviour and outcome. What can you do to help clients regulate their emotions to chose a better and more empowered thinking pattern. 

Do mental models fit in this?



Bioengineering- a term he uses for habit formation and biology. Our biology often turns into our emotions and impacts how we think about something. Our habits always default to something safe and easy. When you are in a particular emotion you tend to have a go to action that developed from childhood as it made/makes us feel safe. 

The habit of the weekend after kids are sleep watch Netflix and opening a particular bag of chips, you do it because you feel calm, safe, that your life is not threatened. It’s a habit you know is not good but you still do it because it is comfortable. 

You clients have the same issue. We often develop our. OST strong habits without even realizing it. As a coach you MUST understand how habits are really created. Ask yourself how are habits created? As one is developed these habits how can you help someone break the habits and install a new one that may help them change their lives. You also want to learn how our biology works. What is it in our health that when we support in a good way we can better manage our states and emotions better. Like eating a donut when we feel stressed. The donut leads to another downward spiral because of the sugar just consumed will take them further down because of the energy spike and downfall.  Bad health further triggers bad behaviour bad habits and more bad responses to the outside world. Learn how to change habits in order to drive better outcomes for your clients.


Connectedness- is referring to things we don’t really understand. Like how are we connected to people energetically, walking into a room and feeling like this person is safe and this person is not. Like feeling right and not feeling right. How do we know in acuity that something is right for us and something is not things like this or what’s referred to as connectedness. What other things are like this in life? We all come from a single source the Big Bang which means we are all connected this is connectedness. 
It’s about leaning into knowingness that you and I are together in this. Leaning further into a study of spirituality , knowingness, connectedness, intuition while also getting your client to lean into it too you find many challenges are easier to overcome and many ambitions are easier to fulfill. 
“Getting in touch with spirituality can make the challenges of life easier
The truth of the universe is that it’s designed here to support you, your journey, the outcomes you want for of your life, that the universe is for you, that it’s flowing through you ( look more into this the science, I think quantum and the blue book you were reading). The question how is it you will help you clients with connectedness, to lean into their intuition, lean into the knowingness that there is something greater than that helps us and supports us. Be sure to learn how this works. Question it for yourself, look into the Quran. What do you believe is the greater source? What is this greater source for? How do you as a coach tap into this source ? And help your clients tap into this source. Once we understand this it makes it easier to aim higher, want bigger things in,life because we know it is all created and it is all there for you as a human to have as a human experience.
