As travellers on this planet we have been given the opportunity to decide our directions in life.

  

Very few of us exercise this right with crystal clear intent and vision, and that’s a waste of human potential.

  

Now, consider this message your encouragement to be courageous. To stop avoiding a life on your terms. To stop denying yourself what is best for you.

  

I am here with you just slightly ahead. I have the clarity and the intent, but what I am missing are my fellow voyagers. 

  

Together we will reinforce our commitment to living and I do this by writing an Oath for myself to my God. 

  

This is done on paper, and by hand. Yes, analogue tools. 

  

We keep it simple, we keep it brief. This is to be a simple exercise though it may be an extremely emotionally charged experience if you are taking this as seriously as you should.

  

You are to declare that you are leaving your old life for the journey of a new one. A life that resonates with the ideal version of you and you ALONE.

  

DO NOT overthink this. BE SELFISH.

  

Once written by hand on paper, you are to sign your name and add the date and time, down to the second if you can.

  

You will review this daily, keep it on your person, have a picture of it on your phone as your wallpaper. This will be your reminder as challenges arise and you feel like quitting. 

  

Take some time during the remainder of the week and make the commitment to yourself. Regardless of what you have going on in your life, you are worthy of better if you decide to work for it.

  

This is where we begin.

  

Peace and Blessings,
