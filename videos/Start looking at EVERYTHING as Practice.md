The creative process has 4 parts no matter the medium
1. Study
2. Training
3. Practice
4. Performance


Study you are learning. To use a tool, watching from a video, copying a master, recreating others works into our own style to learn how they made yours

Training is about commuting what you have learned to memory, this is where mileage comes in. This looks like drawing hands 100 times, or any other object. Raining could be learning to identify parts of anatomy from images. Getting to the point of becoming second nature. It could be mixing paints, or learning a medium like oils to be able to make smooth lines 

Practice is very special, it’s taking what you have learned from the study, and the raw experience from the training and create something. It’s a called a practice when you have mastered something and offer it to others like a dentist. 

“It’s is the practise that is the doing of the thing”

Rehearsals are a form of practice if you were a musician. To practice is to do the thing in its full essence in private.

We have no idea when we will create our final work.

Performance the experience of the creation. Such as reading poetry on a stage and having other listening, or playing a game within a particular timeframe. Performance for art is required the inclusion of an audience to experience your creation.

Performance needs to be defined by you and must be separate from the practice.

Experiences flow to the Brain to nervous system to hand to canvas to the work that you are creating.

“I am an illustrator, this is my practice”

Speaking about your art at a gallery showing is also performance. 

Define what the performance aspect is for you personally.

You need to see the value in the practice of your craft and even nor to enjoy it

Passion and curiosity is required to push through the required efforts needed to become. This is the unfair advantage.

Practice and performance is where art truly takes a life of its own in its expression. 

The study and training are the foundations that make the practice and performance fun.
