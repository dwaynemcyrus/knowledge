A walled garden is necessary structure that a man must build for his wife and in turn his children. The walls in other words boundaries need to be able to expand and contract based on the growth and needs of his wife. 

When and how these walls are move must be within the standards that the man has set for himself and his wife, which must be communicated upfront and when changes are made. These changes must not be frequent or they loose meaning and value.
