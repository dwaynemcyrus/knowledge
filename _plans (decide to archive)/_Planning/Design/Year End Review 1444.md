## How I Felt And Still Feel
How are you really? Remember, there’s no right or wrong way to feel — all feelings are valid.
### What feelings did I feel? Were there any reoccurring patterns?
What are some positive and negative feelings that come to mind? How did the people around me make me feel? How did I make myself feel?
- There’s a great sense of responsibility and ownership over my online community to be more and give more, I feel guilt in not keeping my word to them.
- Frustration and unease with the expression of desire and want of me from a particular woman in my life right now. This feeling is accompanied by a betrayal to self for what I have allowed to occur between us, not maintaining my standards.
- Shame for the state of my life when it comes to my finances, environment, and my belongings. Everything I own is old and at risk of breaking, I need to separate myself from my past.
- Being in the same house as my mother I feel unsafe, often at risk of harm. 
- Embarrassed as a man for now having money, a space of my own, and a car. 
- Proud of myself for pushing forward and continuing to move. I have truly yet to stop.
### Did I allow myself to lean into these feelings? Why or why not?
- I have allowed myself to withdraw and get small because of the triggers of my mother’s way of operating within the house.
- The shame and frustration I have allowed to put me in a state of inaction and action at deferent intervals. Though the inaction is what is experienced more often. 
- Bouts of hope and inspiration that I can change my life in full! 
### Which of these feelings would I like to let go of, and which would I like to take with you into the new year?

### Shame you carry and the acts to turn them into pride…
- **Not keeping my word to self and in turn others:** Treat your words like promises and make them sparingly and only when you have decided and made practical you keeping your word to accomplish the task
- **Living in poverty and having my mother and sister needing to pay for their own things:** Learn to earn far more than you and your family need and pay for all of their needs. Not the extra nonsense, give them an allowance for that monthly. 
- **Hiding my skills and abilities that can certainly better my life:** Present yourself to the world and the skills you possess as a artist, designer, writer, speaker, and brand strategist.
- **The state of my physique, looking like and being unhealthy:** Bodybuilding, martial arts training, and a proper diet to bulk up and gain proper vitamins and protein.
- **My environment and belongings do not reflect the man I am:**  Get rid of all your belongs and replace them with only what you desire and need for your condo apartment.
### Stupid Payoffs…
What are the severely stupid things you are doing, that you know you should change, and could change to better your life?
- Stupid: Not reaching out to my network on a daily basis in order to create new opportunities for myself.
	- Payoff: I do not need to expose myself to the world for judgement on my worthiness.
	- Change: Prepare yourself to be seen and make a habit of reaching out to new people and following up daily.
- Stupid: Not putting my skills of graphic design and knowledge of branding to use in the market to earn money for myself.
	- Payoff: I get to stay poor and staying poor means I get to prove my abusers right instead of wrong which is far more comfortable to me. 
	- Change: Design a new portfolio of 3 pieces, an updated resume, and a new LinkedIn profile.
- Stupid: Not submitting myself to my 20% routine that I know will be responsible for the 80% of progress and success that I need in my life

	- Payoff: I get to hide myself and continue to punish my artist child for not being strong enough to stand firm in being an artist and not being abused sexually.
	- Change: Make a habit of creating art daily, in addition to training your skills in writing, drawing, and painting in digital and traditional.
- Stupid: Not exercising my body on a daily basis and properly nurturing it’s growth and maintenance.

	- Payoff: Is keeping myself in a state of mental stress and financially tied.

### Jealousy Mapping…
Think about the people you wish you could be like or do what it is you see them doing.
**People who are…**
- Successfully running YouTube channels like Hamza.
- Earning upwards of $40k/month online with digital products and memberships like Dan Koe.
- Artists who can paint in both traditional and digital mediums with a dedicated fan base purchasing those works regularly.
- Men who’s bodies are in peak condition, sculpted into manhood, and flexible with full range of motion.
- Men with the network to be able to get things done with small group of other men who support him like Andrew Tate.
- Digital nomads who travel regular and are not locked to any geographic location or government like the Nomad Capitalist.
### Held anger…
Who and what are you angry at? Who are you holding responsible?
- My father for not training me in the skills and knowledge he possessed to better prepare for life as a man. Also for him not being a complete man for himself and tolerating the abuse of my mother.
- My self for allowing me to live small and in oppression by others and finances.
### Limiting beliefs to kill off…
Limiting beliefs are **thoughts, opinions that one believes to be the absolute truth**. They tend to have a negative impact on one's life by stopping them from moving forward and growing on a personal and professional level.
- **A lavish lifestyle is not for me:** The wealth and riches of the world are mine to experience.
- **It is not safe to live and express myself as an artist:** My only safety in this world is in creating artwork.
- **Money is not meant for me, and leads to bad character like my father:** Money loves flowing to me in abundance and it makes me a better man.
