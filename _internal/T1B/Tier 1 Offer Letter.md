Tier 1 Offer Letter — The Indelible Year

Private 1:1 Mentorship with Dwayne M. Cyrus

12 Months • Max Capacity: 3 Men Per Year

  

⸻

  

You’ve built a life that looks strong — but you still feel weak inside.

  

You lead teams, build businesses, support families… but silently carry:

- Emotional confusion
- Suppressed anger
- Hidden wounds you cannot name

  

You’ve tried coaching. You’ve tried therapy. You’ve tried grinding harder.

None of it forged you.

None of it gave you the structure you need — that inner instability.

  

You don’t need more content.

You need a covenant.

And you are finally ready to face yourself.

  

⸻

  

The Indelible Year Defined

This is a 12-month private mentorship built on structure, presence, and earned progression.

  

This is not coaching.

This is initiation.

A covenant between you and me.

  

You begin with a 3-month Proving Ground — a trial under tension.

You show up. You apply. You lead.

  

At the end of 90 days, we both decide whether you’re admitted into the full year.

  

If you’re not accepted — your access ends, clean.

If you are — we continue under the same intensity, across all domains of your life.

  

Structure & Support

- 12-month duration (3-month trial → 9-month continuation)
- Initial 2-hour call to lay our foundation 
- Biweekly 2-hour private mentorship sessions
- Personalized Command & Discipline Protocol
- Tactical integration and progress tracking between sessions

  

Asynchronous Support

- Voice message + text access via Telegram
- Response Windows: Sunday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday
- 24-hour response time (not instant access — you learn presence through order)
- Saturday is reserved for high-pressure moments. If you are breaking, you bring it here. Presence means using the structure — not bypassing it.

  

I do not respond outside of these windows — not out of avoidance, but because your growth deserves a guide who walks with order, not noise.

  

Core Principles

- No off weeks. No postponements. Presence is non-negotiable.
- Reconstruction through pressure — not pep talks.
- A permanent shift in how you handle silence, suffering, and self-command.

  

This is not behavior change.

This is internal reconstitution.

The Transformation Roadmap

Every man who enters The Indelible Year follows the 5-Stage Sovereign Path:

  

1. Confront — Name the wound. Cut the pattern. Face the truth.
2. Cleanse — Strip the shame. Reprogram the nervous system. Stand in your worth.
3. Cultivate — Command your emotions. Speak with precision. Show strength without collapse.
4. Connect — Lead your home. Speak the truth. Drop the mask.
5. Construct — Live your code. Build your house. Protect what’s sacred.

  

This isn’t just about your calm.

This is about your bloodline.

About becoming the man your family can trust when the world collapses.

Terms & Commitment

3-Month Proving Ground: 19’200 CHF paid in full — required to begin.

  

9-Month Continuation: 57’600 CHF paid quarterly or in full once accepted beyond the Proving Ground.

  

Payment: Stripe. No refunds. No discounts.

  

The Guarantee

You earn your outcome through presence, not payments.

  

No shortcuts.

  

If you show up to every call, complete every assignment, and hold your end of the agreement — and still see no meaningful shift — I’ll work with you for up to 3 additional months at no additional cost.

  

This is a covenant. Not a course.

I don’t abandon men who walk with integrity.

But I also don’t carry those who won’t move.

  

You need order that forges you into the man you claim to be — this is where you prove it.

  

If you quit, it is a 6-month wait period for re-application. Acceptance is at my sole discretion.

  

⸻

  

If you want to be considered, reply with:

“YEAR ONE.”

  

That confirms you accept the terms and are ready to commit.

- If no seats are open, you’ll be placed on the priority waitlist.
- If a seat is open, you’ll receive a private Stripe link.
- Payment locks your place. No calls. No negotiation.
- Payment must be completed within 48 hours of receiving the link — or the seat is forfeited.

  

You are not applying to join a program.

You are stepping into command.

If you hesitate, you are not ready.
