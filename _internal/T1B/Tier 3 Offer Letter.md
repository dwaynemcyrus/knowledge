Tier 3 Offer Letter

- Have an internal procedures document for each tier outlining what I need to be delivering on, the how, the when, the why?

- Name the first meeting something as Council doesn’t read well, it’s not a council 
- Receive the copy of the oath as a seperate document 

  

  

⚔️ Good. Here’s the final copy for Tier 3 — The Iron Watch Sales Letter. It integrates the naval duty cycle of Iron Watch, the crucible tone of The Rite, and the structural updates we’ve finalized (4-month intensive, pairs, assignments, evaluations, inspection/exit calls).

  

Save as:

[Final Draft] Tier 3 — Iron Watch Sales Letter

  

⸻

  

Tier 3 — The Iron Watch

  

A Crucible of Duty for Men Who Refuse to Drift

4-Month Intensive • 12 Men Maximum • Invitation Only

  

⸻

  

The Call-Out

  

You’ve survived what should have killed you.

You’ve proven you can hold discipline alone.

  

But survival isn’t sovereignty.

And discipline without duty collapses in silence.

  

Most men stay strong but spinning.

Capable but cracked.

Respected publicly — but rotting privately.

  

The Iron Watch is where that ends.

This is the crucible where men are exposed, tested, and rebuilt under constant duty.

  

You weren’t added here.

You were chosen to stand the Watch.

  

⸻

  

The Iron Watch Defined

  

On a ship, the Watch is sacred.

Men take shifts on deck — eyes sharp, presence unbroken. If the Watch fails, the fleet is endangered.

  

The Iron Watch is the cohort equivalent: 12 men, locked into 4 months of shared duty.

  

This is not a mastermind.

This is not a brotherhood.

This is not a Zoom call disguised as work.

  

This is men under watch — sharpened by accountability, stripped of drift, and rebuilt through fire.

  

⸻

  

The Outcome

  

Inside the Watch, you will:

• Train a defined skill or attribute under constant inspection

• Be held under weekly duty — presence is non-negotiable

• Face tactical assignments that demand proof, not talk

• Carry and be carried by your brotherhood pair — his drift is your drift

• Submit to bi-weekly accountability check-ins, exposing progress and failure in public view

• Stand two evaluations: midpoint and final, where your brothers measure your endurance under fire

• Leave not as a man who survived, but as a man who commands himself under pressure

  

This is not optional attendance.

This is duty under fire.

  

⸻

  

Structure & Support

• Cohort Size: 12 men maximum. Fixed. No mid-cycle entry.

• Duration: 4 months. An intensive crucible.

• Group Councils: Weekly 90-minute councils — hot-seats, drills, counsel, and correction.

• Brotherhood Pairs: Fixed for the full cycle. You hold him. He holds you. His drift is your drift.

• Assignments & Challenges: Weekly tactical work that forces clarity, exposure, and execution. Proof required. No excuses.

• Bi-Weekly Check-Ins: Every two weeks, each man submits a sharp accountability report in the Watch Thread. No drift. No delays.

• Midpoint Evaluation: At 2 months, your weak points are measured against your progress.

• Final Watch: At 4 months, you stand before your brothers again — proving what you’ve built.

• Inspection Call: Before the Watch begins, you complete a private inspection call — to confirm standards, name your weak point, and prepare for the oath.

• Exit Call: At the end, you complete a final review call — to measure the man who entered against the man who leaves.

  

⸻

  

Standards

• You will show up on time.

• You will submit assignments and check-ins by the deadline.

• You will not hide, deflect, or posture.

• Drift, ghosting, or excuses = immediate removal.

  

If you fail to hold presence, you will be removed clean.

Re-entry is only by my discretion — 3, 6, or 12 months later, or never.

  

This is not about “learning.”

This is about being witnessed, tested, and rebuilt.

  

⸻

  

Core Principles

• Presence is duty.

• No man hides on Watch.

• The Watch does not break — you break or you rise.

• Weakness is not hidden. It is confronted.

• Proof over talk.

• You are corrected, not coddled.

  

⸻

  

Terms & Investment

• 4-month container

• 2’400 CHF/month

• 12 men maximum

• Invitation only — drawn from Tier 1, Tier 4, or Tier 5

• Payment: Stripe. No refunds. No discounts.

  

⸻

  

The Guarantee

  

You earn your outcome through presence, not payments.

No shortcuts. No refunds.

  

If you drift, the Watch will expose you.

  

This is not a program.

This is duty under fire.

  

⸻

  

Entry

  

Entry into The Iron Watch is by invitation only.

  

If you’ve received this letter, you’ve already been identified as a candidate.

  

To confirm your seat, follow the private instructions you’ve been given.

Presence secures your place. Nothing else.

  

⸻

  

Final Word

  

Captains are drilled.

Admirals sit in counsel.

  

But it is the Watch that proves if a man can endure.

  

This is your Iron Watch.

Stand your duty — or be exposed.

  

⸻

  

⚓ This version is now airtight:

• Naval metaphor (Watch, duty, vigilance).

• Crucible tone (forged, exposed, rebuilt).

• Clear structure (councils, pairs, assignments, inspections, evaluations, exit).

• Heavy standards and consequences.

• Consistent with Tier 1, 2, and 4 hierarchy.

  

⸻

  

Do you want me to now draft the Onboarding Covenant for Tier 3 — The Iron Watch, weaving in the Inspection Call, the Oath (spoken + written), and the public exposure of each man’s weak point?
