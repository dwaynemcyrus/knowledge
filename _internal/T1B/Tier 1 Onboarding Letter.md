Tier 1 Onboarding Covenant — The Indelible Year

Status: Active | Client-Facing (after payment)

Note: Covenant for men entering The Indelible Year. Operational rules and expectations.

  

———

  

Welcome

This is not a casual space.

It is a covenant between you and me.

  

You are here to rupture, rebuild, and recommit.

No half-measures. No drift. No hiding.

  

By entering, you agree to show up fully, hold the standard without compromise, and accept correction without resistance.

  

If it shakes you — good. That means the fire has found you. Presence is required.

  

If you walk away, you do so knowing the covenant stands:

- No refunds.
- A 6-month wait before re-application.
- Acceptance after the wait period is at my sole discretion.

  

This is your forge.

This is your transformation.

Structure

- 12-month duration (3-month Proving Ground → 9-month continuation)
- Initial 2-hour call to lay our foundation 
- Biweekly 2-hour private mentorship sessions
- Personalized Command & Discipline Protocol
- Tactical integration and progress tracking between sessions

  

Asynchronous Support

- Voice message + text access via Telegram
- Response Windows: Sunday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday
- 24-hour response time (not instant access — you learn presence through order)
- Saturday is reserved for high-pressure moments. If you are breaking, you bring it here. Presence means using the structure — not bypassing it.

I do not respond outside of these windows — not out of avoidance, but because your growth deserves a guide who walks with order, not noise.

Rules of Engagement

To remain in this covenant, you must:

- Commit fully to the 3-month Proving Ground without negotiation or refund.
- Maintain full sobriety — no weed, no vapes, no alcohol, no substances that fog or weaken you.
- Train your body. Document your mind. Guard your soul.
- Take full responsibility for your triggers, wounds, and projections.
- Refuse victimhood. Refuse excuses.
- Be fully present during sessions — no multitasking, no half-attendance.
- Never ghost. Never drift.

  

If you break a standard, you will be called out.

If you repeatedly break standards, you are removed, clean.

  

At all times, I reserve the right to remove you immediately, at my sole discretion, if your conduct violates the covenant or the container.

  

This is not punishment.

This is protection — of the work, the men, and what is sacred.

Transformation Roadmap

Every man in The Indelible Year experiences the 5-Stage Sovereign Path:

  

Confront — Name the wound. Cut the pattern. Face the truth.

Every man must face what he’s running from — the wounds, lies, and patterns that keep him bound. This is where the mask breaks and the real work begins.

  

Cleanse — Strip the shame. Reprogram the nervous system. Stand in your worth.

You don’t heal by ignoring the pain — you purge it. Here, you reclaim clarity and worth by feeling without collapse and rewiring the body for power.

  

Cultivate — Command your emotions. Speak with precision. Show strength without collapse.

Through discipline, emotional control, and masculine rituals, you become the man who leads himself with calm and order.

  

Connect — Lead your home. Speak the truth. Drop the mask.

Here you build trust-based relationships and brotherhood rooted in truth — not performance or collapse. Vulnerability becomes power, not weakness.

  

Construct — Live your code. Build your house. Protect what’s sacred.

This is integration. You design a life of righteous order — leading your family, walking in legacy, embodying the man your bloodline needed all along.

Terms & Commitment

You enter under these terms, without negotiation:

  

- Proving Ground (Already Paid):

19,200 CHF in full — already secured as your entry into this covenant.

- Continuation (Pending):

57,600 CHF for the remaining 9 months.

Payment is due quarterly or in full, once you are accepted beyond the trial.

- Payment: Stripe. No refunds. No discounts.

  

If you quit, you break covenant. You forfeit your place. You will wait 6 months before re-application, and acceptance after that is at my sole discretion.

  

You are not held to your invoice.

You are held to your word.

Confidentiality & Recording Policy

By entering this covenant, you agree to:

- All mentorship sessions may be audio recorded for internal use — to sharpen the guidance you receive and uphold the precision of the work.
- These recordings remain private and are never shared externally without your written consent.
- Confidentiality is absolute. What happens in this container and with fellow Voyagers stays sealed.

  

If you breach confidentiality, you are removed instantly. No warnings. No ceremony.
