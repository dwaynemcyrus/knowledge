Guide to what line of work to focus on and support with my other ventures?

  

Open: 75:19 Subhan’Allah this is so direct Allah. I made sure to do my best to align my feeling with my mind. 

  

First: 42:48 This directly speaks to my Dawah work and that I must remain great full in my doings. Especially the bad situation I currently am in remain grateful of Allah!!! 

  

Second: 42:5 Praise Allah and seek forgiveness, wrap everything you do around praising Allah. All of your works and efforts! 

  

Third: 105:2 This sound like reminds of Allahs power to change one’s course for rotection from threat. (1-5) Why do you not trust in Allah when he commands you and give you guidance! Act on it! Be like the prophet in trust and faith in Allah.

  

Close: 52:45 The judgement of others leave this alone, be Muslim!!!
