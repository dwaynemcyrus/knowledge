## Akhirah
Forming a brotherhood will keep men alive and give them a space to belong, to share, to vent, to be built men in service of Allah SWT
## Vision
A worldwide brotherhood of men from all walks of life, skills, ethnicities, cultures, etc. My network is vast and deep from the political leaders to the mo bosses, but all men of value, morals, and fear of God. No matter what I need at any point in time I can say, “I got a guy for that”.
My Tatsu is formed a much more intimate group of men of a mission to be and remain the best of men in all things at all times. These are my brothers, we have nothing but loyalty between us. No woman, status, or money sways our morals and values. These gentlemen are Muslim and we ride together often and always as men who are conquering the world.
I am always sought after for social events and opportunities to engage in new ventures and projects or to just bond and spend quality time together as men. Holding memberships to the most exclusive clubs to men of means, I am truly connected.
Anywhere in the world, I am connected with men who have the most respect for me and gratitude for my presence. I am a connector amongst my peers, I am that guy, [[Actualized Self]].
