I Dwayne Cyrus have decided to let go of it all in my heart. The people pleasing, the opinions of others, the need to being loved and appreciated by my mother. 

I am only working towards pleasing Allah, and nothing else. This requires me to care for myself first, to do what Allah has shown me. To no longer to deny the signs, the plethora of signs Allah has confirmed for me as my life's direction and work.
