### Rules
- Keep your mini essay to one single idea.
- Do not link multiple ideas within the essay, instead make them between essays.
- Keep the essays short, so that they do not become full writing projects.
- Have your system of organization for your essays using tags, folder, and links. He has a video on using Obsidian for this.
- A good tip is to write as long as you can see on the screen 
### Structure
- intro, body, conclusion
- “The tallest trees have the deepest roots”
#### Writing the Intro
- the hook, pull the readers attention and present the premise of the essay
- Make it a sentence or two, it doesn’t have to be long
- Goals: make the premise as clear as possible, don’t be mysterious and vague. Be clear be fast once a reader as understanding of to expect they will most likely want to stay
- Goals: spark curiosity, tease hidden details that are to come
- Make a bold statement: state the point “video games often stimulate masculine pursuits”
- Use emotional language: target the readers feelings, capture the human experience by pushing them straight into the drama, paint the picture
- Ask a question: it builds curiosity and directs the reader to learn the answer, use questions that the readers would have
- Tell a story: put the reader in the middle of the story
#### Writing the Body
- This is where you get to guide the reader through the thought process
- Explain, add details, paint the picture
- If you understand the idea well this step won’t be an issue just talk about it in the way you understand 
- If you struggle at any point to express something do the 10 second prompt, look away from the screen and look at the material removing all hindsight and read it from start to finish putting yourself in the readers shoes to see if it flows and makes sense
- You want the text to be logical and easy to read 
#### Writing the Conclusion
- a powerful conclusion make a person out the book down and say damn what did I just read
- This is your last impression, and it must hit
- Take all your details and condense it into a final message
- Let the conclusion be a sentence or two in order to  pin the idea down
#### Writing Story Essays
- the great way to practice writing fiction
- This type of note is more powerful then a regular mini essay 
- Story notes use a story to communicate the idea, the story is the vehicle
- It can be your own story from life or a story retold from someone else
- You learn about ambition reading Macbeth, then reading a wiki about ambition
- A mix of story and classic, start with the story then discuss the idea the story is driving, the vehicle
- Take previous written stories and adapt them to drive your own point with the story’s message
- To start you need to ask what the point I’m trying to get across and the story you use needs to match or it won’t make sense it will confuse or distract the readers. you must decide the point before the story.
