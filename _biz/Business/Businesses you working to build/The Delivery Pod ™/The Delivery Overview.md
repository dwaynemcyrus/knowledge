Description for anchor
A weekly podcast dedicated to helping marriage-minded women navigate the realities of men with your host Cyrus who will also be your guide through the world of courtship. The intent is to minimize the damage that modern dating causes by educating good women on who men are and how to work with us. 


Men don't seek attention, we seek status....
- women want attention and think thats the exchange
- men want statis and not to lose
- hard wiring...safety and gain from prople, validation through attention, men validate through status, that why beauty matters, where feminists are lost cause they seek status
- "value to self based on attetion vs your status from work and dismissing attention"
- "do you feel enough from your work status", among why mothers push daughter to
- You gain nothing delaying marriage 
- The stoic women when she is lacking in emotions, doesn't mean she doesn't care, she looses the ability to show care
- You ability, to care is never a weakness, women caring is weakness, feminism modern woman stuff to be like men, not that men don't care its how we show is different and women don't know how to model it
- "he doesn;t care as much as i do" is women measuring men based on how they measure us
- why do men cheat
