### Stage 01 - Design 
Sections: Origins, Reason, Legacy, Identity, Brand, Seal

You are defining who you want to become, and designing the ship that will take you there. Let's get you in order, who are you and what it is you are achieving and aiming to leaving after you die.

This is about clarity of who you are, your desires, and way of being.
#### Origin
Phase 01: Analysis of your past, present, and future.

Phase 02: List key events and memories in your life from birth to present day. Rewrite these events, through the exercise from Souen. The point is make your story a beneficial one.
#### Reason
Work Files: [[SOS 1445-1446 Reason]]

Phase 01: Do not limit your mind and fill out each section with complete honesty in the following order: Love Doing, Good At, World Needs, Paid For.

Steps
1. Brain dump into all of the areas that fit each category based on their prompts.
2. Refine and organize your lists by giving them numbers, and these numbers are not based on any order or hierarchy, it’s for ranking maybe.

Phase 02: Seek out complimentary connections between each category list. You are looking at the overlaps in reference to the diagram example.

**Steps:**
1. Making complimentary connections (links/themes) between the categories of "good at" "world needs", etc. You want to find what combinations work well together, as many as possible. Starting with what the world, paid, good ,and then love. This part is best done on paper and or with digital stickies, white boarding ya know! Use this area to document the themes you came up with...go for quantity over quality, have fun.
2. Remove any connection that do not give you an opportunity to be paid in a relatively obvious way.
3. For each list you want to pull out the top 9-12 items that rank the highest for you.

Phase 03
It’s time for your statement work. More play to occur, we going to begin plugging in your themes to see what resonates best with you.

Steps:
1. Start with your core building blocks 
2. Put together your purpose statement 
3. Create your intersections 
#### Legacy
Work Files: [[SOS 1445-1446 Legacy]]

Here you will get clarity on the legacy you want to leave after you die. Some of the information needed below may actually come out of the Authoring work, so keep that in mind.

> Definition: a gift by will especially of money or other personal property / something transmitted by or received from an ancestor or predecessor or from the past / is passed from one generation to the next and often refers to gifts of money or property

Phase 01
Let's get to the core of who you are to accomplish finding the legacy you will leave behind after your passing.

Steps:
1. Answer each question to reflect the core of your story
2. Get clear on the categories of people who can benefit from your lived experiences thus far.
3. Lastly, you will describe your One Person, this is who you need to impact most, basically think about the past you, the child you, and where your legacy will primarily be built on.

Phase 02
We need to gain an understanding for what would be most valuable to these groupings of people we are going to be serving to build our legacy upon. We will be making use of the Value Proposition Design by Alex Osterwalder process.

Steps:
1. Name/Describe each legacy profile in 2-3 words (this may be best done last)
2. Brainstorm and list out the jobs, pains, and lastly the gains for each profile
3. Rank each category with their respective measures
4. Brainstorm and list out the products & services, pain relievers, and gain creators for each profile
5. Based on your One Person profile fill out the top 3-6 jobs, pains, and gains
6. Based on your One Person profile fill out the top 3-6 products & services, pain relievers, and gain creators

Phase 03
We will get clear on the person we are speaking to and working towards impacting the most in our everyday life through some form of documentation.

**Steps:**
- Based on the One Person profile you will now create your legacy statement.
- Fill in the top 3 components per section of statement based on the profile work in the previous section.
- Draft statements based on the tope 3 components until you find the one that resonates best with you. Starting with what your core offer/product is that you will serve people through.
- Begin to think about how your product will live on after your die
- Describe the impact of your person life and those like them
- Describe how the people would describe you and what you did when alive.
- Imagine and describe the impact that you will leave based on your statement
- Describe the remnants of the works and what is happening with them
- Visualize the works.
#### Identity
Work Files: [[SOS 1445-1446 Identity]]

Inner is focused on what in my heart and soul just for me... what makes me at my core.

Let's work the core system to develop one's identity (personal brand) stuff ya know... This work is meant to continue off of the legacy work yea? Or this just the manifesto? What's the end result? Keep in mind this area is still building off of the Legacy work, which may need to be number 3 in the order of things.

Bonus work at the end is to write your story! Like how Charles has asked you to do. Maybe this exercise starts with key highlights in chronological order. Then you go off and write the story.

Phase 01
You need to identify with others so that you are not walking blindly when you do not have to. Men who have walked similar paths before you to guide you along in your development.

Steps:
1. Based on your legacy work list out examples of men who have achieved and represent the legacy you want to leave.
2. For each person you will fill in what it is you appreciate about them
3. For each person you will list the values you want to embody from them
4. Review the values for each person and make note of those that show up most often and rank there resonance with yourself
5. Define your top 3 values
6. Create your system of values using your core inner value to access you external result creating values as the entrance to the most common values from your council.
7. Based on the values within your council what are the top three? These are your core values.
8. Next you will create your system of values using your core inner value to access you external result creating values as the entrance to the most common values from your council.

Phase 02
We are going to pull on the core of who you are. Take time to think deeply on this, review previous material and your annual review questions.

Steps:
1. List 6 to 12 core beliefs that you will live and die by. There are no wiggle room for this, they are set in stone as part of how you live. The order does not matter, keep it short and sweet.
2. Review the each item and set with how it feels to you. This is to ensure it holds true.
3. Based on your beliefs write yourself a short mantra to have memorized to combat a core negative story about yourself.
4. Write yourself a few reminders about who you are in the I statements.

Phase 03
Getting a grip on your deepest desire and expectations that the world has placed on you.

Steps:
1. Brainstorm what you desire most out of this world.
2. Decide on the top 3 that would most change your life if achieved.
3. Brainstorms the times and frequency in which you are called upon to do a certain thing or show up in a certain way for others.
4. Decide on the top 3 that would most resonate with you and impact the most people.

Additional Notes:
- These desires are meant to be short and specific. Remember these are not negotiable, no matter what happens in your life. Top 3 before you die.
- We do need an exercise for this. Think "what to be known for doing?"
- I think these stem from your purpose of legacy work be sure to check

Phase 04
This is the work to set in right the core attributes that will shape your actions in the world.

Steps:
1. Do a brief reflection on the answers from the previous exercise on what skills you posses that align with your answers

3. What are the truths about yourself that you know are true regardless of how much they have manifested themselves in the world thus far.
4. List the lines that you cannot cross yourself out of fear of compromising you are and turning against yourself in a way of betrayal.

Additional Notes:
- These are your top 3 not negotiable things that the world commonly asks from you. What is it that you are passionate about in this life, that other constantly or even your inner voice calls on you to be doing everyday. We do need an exercise for this.

Phase 05
- Take the test from [StrengthFinder 2.0](capacitor://localhost/StrengthFinder%202.0) and fill out the summary of your learnings.
- Take the test from [Kolbe A Index Assessment](capacitor://localhost/Kolbe%20A%20Index%20Assessment)and fill out the summary of your learnings.

Steps:
1. Do a brief reflection on the answers from the previous exercise on what skills you posses that align with your answers

3. What are the truths about yourself that you know are true regardless of how much they have manifested themselves in the world thus far.
4. List the lines that you cannot cross yourself out of fear of compromising you are and turning against yourself in a way of betrayal.
