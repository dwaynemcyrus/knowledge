description: THE SELF-PUBLISHED PHENOMENON —NOW FULLY REVISED AND EXPANDED I almost didn’t publish Love Yourself Like Your Life Depends on It. Here I was, a CEO who’d fallen apart after his company failed, writing a book about how loving himself saved him. I thought I’d be a laughingstock and my career would be finished. But I stepped through the fears and shared my truth with the world. The book went viral. Amazing people all over bought copies for friends and family. For some, this book saved their lives. For others, it was the first time they ever loved themselves. Many readers reached out and asked questions. This taught me that, to create lasting impact, I had to go deeper. So, seven years later, here it is. All the questions I received, resolved. My intention is that by the time you finish this new edition, not only will you be committed to loving yourself, you’ll know exactly how to do it. And, most importantly, how to make it last.
